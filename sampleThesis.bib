  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many cancer genomes are extensively rearranged with
              highly aberrant chromosomal karyotypes. Structural and copy
              number variations in cancer genomes can be determined via
              abnormal mapping of sequenced reads to the reference genome.
              Recently it became possible to reconcile both of these types of
              large-scale variations into a karyotype graph representation of
              the rearranged cancer genomes. Such a representation, however,
              does not directly describe the linear and/or circular structure
              of the underlying rearranged cancer chromosomes, thus limiting
              possible analysis of cancer genomes somatic evolutionary process
              as well as functional genomic changes brought by the large-scale
              genome rearrangements. RESULTS: Here we address the
              aforementioned limitation by introducing a novel methodological
              framework for recovering rearranged cancer chromosomes from
              karyotype graphs. For a cancer karyotype graph we formulate an
              Eulerian Decomposition Problem (EDP) of finding a collection of
              linear and/or circular rearranged cancer chromosomes that are
              determined by the graph. We derive and prove computational
              complexities for several variations of the EDP. We then
              demonstrate that Eulerian decomposition of the cancer karyotype
              graphs is not always unique and present the Consistent Contig
              Covering Problem (CCCP) of recovering unambiguous cancer contigs
              from the cancer karyotype graph, and describe a novel algorithm
              CCR capable of solving CCCP in polynomial time. We apply CCR on a
              prostate cancer dataset and demonstrate that it is capable of
              consistently recovering large cancer contigs even when underlying
              cancer genomes are highly rearranged. CONCLUSIONS: CCR can
              recover rearranged cancer contigs from karyotype graphs thereby
              addressing existing limitation in inferring chromosomal

              normal cells and subpopulations of cancer cells, or clones, that
              harbor distinct somatic mutations. We introduce a new algorithm,

              haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer
              genomes from DNA sequencing data from a bulk tumor sample. RCK
              leverages evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutational

Cells continuously rewire their metabolic networks in response to changes in environmental conditions to sustain fitness. Studies of the systemic properties of metabolic networks give insight into metabolic plasticity and robustness, and the ability of organisms to cope with different environments. Constraint-based stoichiometric modeling of metabolic networks has become an indispensable tool for such studies. Herein, we review the basic theoretical underpinnings of constraint-based stoichiometric modeling of metabolic networks. Basic concepts, such as stoichiometry, chemical moiety conservation, flux modes, flux balance analysis, and flux solution spaces, are explained with simple, illustrative examples. We emphasize the mathematical definitions and their network topological interpretations.},

              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging

              genomic variation across thousands of tumor whole genome
              sequences. It is not known to what extent the shortcomings of
              short read ($\leq$ 150 bp) whole genome sequencing (WGS) used for
              structural variant analysis has limited our understanding of
              cancer genome structure. To formally address this, we introduce
              the concept of ``loose ends'' - copy number alterations that
              cannot be mapped to a rearrangement by WGS but can be indirectly
              detected through the analysis of junction-balanced genome graphs.
              Analyzing 2,319 pan-cancer WGS cases across 31 tumor types, we
              found loose ends were enriched in reference repeats and fusions
              of the mappable genome to repetitive or foreign sequences. Among
              these we found genomic footprints of neotelomeres, which were
              surprisingly enriched in cancers with low telomerase expression
              and alternate lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Our results
              also provide a rigorous upper bound on the role of non-allelic
              homologous recombination (NAHR) in large-scale cancer structural
              variation, while nominating INO80 , FANCA , and ARID1A as

              that short read WGS maps >97\% of all large-scale (>10 kbp)

               has been identified in only a few cases. Most of these

               from a healthy mother to her child with congenital abnormalities
               probably caused by de novo copy-number changes of dosage
               sensitive genes. We describe a G-CTH transmitted through three
               generations in 11 healthy carriers. METHODS: Conventional
               cytogenetic analysis, mate-pair sequencing, and polymerase chain
               reaction (PCR) were used to identify the chromosome
               rearrangement and characterize the breakpoints in all three
               generations. RESULTS: We identified an apparently balanced
               translocation t(3;5), later shown to be a G-CTH, in all
               individuals of a three-generation family. The G-CTH stably
               segregated without occurrence of additional rearrangements;
               however, several spontaneous abortions were reported, possibly
               due to unbalanced transmission. Although seven protein-coding
               genes are interrupted, no clinical features can be definitively
               attributed to the affected genes. However, it can be speculated
               that truncation of one of these genes, encoding
               ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR), a
               key component of the DNA damage response, may be related to
               G-CTH formation. CONCLUSION: G-CTH rearrangements are not always
               associated with abnormal phenotypes and may be misinterpreted as
               balanced two-way translocations, suggesting that G-CTH is an

              identified in previous studies. We examine the spectrum of
              structural variants (SVs) instigated by natural telomere crisis.
              Eight spontaneous post-crisis clones did not show prominent
              patterns of BFB cycles or chromothripsis. Their crisis-induced
              genome rearrangements varied from infrequent simple SVs to more
              frequent and complex SVs. In contrast, BFB cycles and
              chromothripsis occurred in MRC5 fibroblast clones that escaped
              telomere crisis after CRISPR-controlled telomerase activation.
              This system revealed convergent evolutionary lineages altering
              one allele of chromosome 12p, where a short telomere likely
              predisposed to fusion. Remarkably, the 12p chromothripsis and BFB

  abstract = {Transcript alterations often result from somatic changes in
              cancer genomes1. Various forms of RNA alterations have been
              described in cancer, including overexpression2, altered splicing3
              and gene fusions4; however, it is difficult to attribute these to
              underlying genomic changes owing to heterogeneity among patients
              and tumour types, and the relatively small cohorts of patients
              for whom samples have been analysed by both transcriptome and
              whole-genome sequencing. Here we present, to our knowledge, the
              most comprehensive catalogue of cancer-associated gene
              alterations to date, obtained by characterizing tumour
              transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of
              Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer
              Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)5.
              Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we associated several
              categories of RNA alterations with germline and somatic DNA
              alterations, and identified probable genetic mechanisms. Somatic
              copy-number alterations were the major drivers of variations in
              total gene and allele-specific expression. We identified 649
              associations of somatic single-nucleotide variants with gene
              expression in cis, of which 68.4\% involved associations with
              flanking non-coding regions of the gene. We found 1,900 splicing
              alterations associated with somatic mutations, including the
              formation of exons within introns in proximity to Alu elements.
              In addition, 82\% of gene fusions were associated with structural
              variants, including 75 of a new class, termed 'bridged' fusions,
              in which a third genomic location bridges two genes. We observed
              transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer
              types and have associations with variations in DNA mutational
              signatures. This compendium of RNA alterations in the genomic
              context provides a rich resource for identifying genes and
              mechanisms that are functionally implicated in cancer.},

              across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural
              variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution,
              assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in
              late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem
              duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are
              enriched in early-replicating regions-as are unbalanced
              translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement
              generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number
              gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent
              structure consists of 2-7 templates copied from distinct regions
              of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of
              templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in
              liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide
              variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which

               combining significance levels from multiple methods of driver
               discovery that overcomes the limitations of individual methods.
               For structural variants, we present two methods of driver
               discovery, and identify regions that are significantly affected
               by recurrent breakpoints and recurrent somatic juxtapositions.
               Our analyses confirm previously reported drivers6,7, raise

               regions of NFKBIZ and TOB1, focal deletions in BRD4 and

               less frequent in non-coding genes and regulatory sequences than
               in protein-coding genes, additional examples of these drivers

              complexity and the difficulty of extracting SVs from assembly
              contigs. We describe SvABA, an efficient and accurate method for
              detecting SVs from short-read sequencing data using genome-wide
              local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We
              evaluated SvABA's performance on the NA12878 human genome and in

              CFSs are evolutionarily conserved and late replicating regions
              with AT-rich sequences, and CFS instability is correlated with
              cancer. In the last decade, much progress has been made toward
              understanding the mechanisms of chromosomal instability at CFSs.
              However, despite tremendous efforts, identifying a
              cancer-associated CFS gene (CACG) remains a challenge and little
              is known about the function of CACGs at most CFS loci. Recent
              studies of FATS (for Fragile-site Associated Tumor Suppressor), a
              new CACG at FRA10F, reveal an active role of this CACG in
              regulating DNA damage checkpoints and suppressing tumorigenesis.
              The identification of FATS may inspire more discoveries of other
              uncharacterized CACGs. Further elucidation of the biological
              functions and clinical significance of CACGs may be exploited for

              presents a comprehensive analysis using conventional and
              molecular cytogenetic mapping of CFSs and their expression
              frequencies in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6, and in

              levels in chromosome bands are conserved between the two mouse
              strains and between syntenic mouse and human DNA segments.
              Furthermore, four additional mouse CFSs were found to be
              homologous to human CFSs on the molecular cytogenetic level

              CFSs are related or why some genomic loci are much more prone to
              their occurrence. Here we compare large sets of de novo CNVs and

              overlapping genomic features. We first show that CNV hotpots and
              CFSs occurred at the same human loci within a given cultured cell
              line. Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing further demonstrated that
              although genomic regions with low CNV frequencies were enriched
              in transcribed genes, the CNV hotpots that matched CFSs
              specifically corresponded to the largest active transcription
              units in both human and mouse cells. Consistently, active
              transcription units >1 Mb were robust cell-type-specific
              predictors of induced CNV hotspots and CFS loci. Unlike most

              their transcribed and flanking regions, respectively, supporting
              a role for transcription in replication-dependent lesion
              formation. These results indicate that active large transcription
              units drive extreme locus- and cell-type-specific genomic
              instability under replication stress, resulting in both CNVs and

From this resource we have defined variation in mitotic mis-segregation rates across tissue types and genotypes. Analysis of matched genomic and image measurements revealed correlations between cellular morphology and genome ploidy states. Aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles allowed for calculation of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inference of clonal phylogenies and avoided the limitations of bulk deconvolution.

We used this relationship to analyze variation in replication timing among 161 individuals sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. Genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing. We call these "replication timing quantitative trait loci" (rtQTLs). rtQTLs involved the differential use of replication origins, exhibited allele-specific effects on replication timing, and associated with gene expression variation at megabase scales.

BRCA1-mutant cancers show minimal resection of double-strand breaks, which renders them deficient in homology-directed repair and sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)3–8. When BRCA1 is absent, the resection of double-strand breaks is thought to be prevented by 53BP1, RIF1 and the REV7–SHLD1–SHLD2–SHLD3 (shieldin) complex, and loss of these factors diminishes sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors4,6–9. Here we address the mechanism by which 53BP1–RIF1–shieldin regulates the generation of recombinogenic 3′ overhangs. We report that CTC1–STN1–TEN1 (CST)10, a complex similar to replication protein A that functions as an accessory factor of polymerase-α (Polα)–primase11, is a downstream effector in the 53BP1 pathway. CST interacts with shieldin and localizes with Polα to sites of DNA damage in a 53BP1- and shieldin-dependent manner. As with loss of 53BP1, RIF1 or shieldin, the depletion of CST leads to increased resection. In BRCA1-deficient cells, CST blocks RAD51 loading and promotes the efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors. In addition, Polα inhibition diminishes the effect of PARP1 inhibitors. These data suggest that CST–Polα-mediated fill-in helps to control the repair of double-strand breaks by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin. 53BP1 and shieldin recruit the CTC1–STN1–TEN1 complex and polymerase-α to sites of DNA damage to help control the repair of double-strand breaks.}},

The data reveal two DNA damage response pathways not previously observed upon deletion of individual shelterin proteins. The shelterin-free telomeres are processed by microhomology-mediated alternative-NHEJ when Ku70/80 is absent and are attacked by nucleolytic degradation in the absence of 53BP1. The data establish that the end-protection problem is specified by six pathways [ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related) signaling, classical-NHEJ, alt-NHEJ, homologous recombination, and resection] and show how shelterin acts with general DNA damage response factors to solve this problem.}},

Detailed G-band analysis of the subclone revealed that an HSR on the short arm of chromosome 3 became unstable and changed its position within the chromosome. The evolution of this marker chromosome was associated with the terminal deletion of the normal long arm of the HSR-bearing chromosome 3 and may have involved ring formation as a result of fusion between the HSR on the short arm and the broken end of the long arm. Evidence was obtained for breakage at different sites within the ring, producing chromosomes with HSRs located terminally on either the long arms or both arms. The terminally located HSR underwent elongation in some cells presumably as a result of a breakage-fusionbridge cycle characteristic of instability due to telomeric loss. It is suggested that terminally located HSRs may generally occur this way.}},

              DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fragile sites are the chromosomal regions that are
              susceptible to breakage, and their frequency varies among the
              human population. Based on the frequency of fragile site
              induction, they are categorized as common and rare fragile sites.
              Common fragile sites are sensitive to replication stress and
              often rearranged in cancer. Rare fragile sites are the archetypal
              trinucleotide repeats. Fragile sites are known to be involved in
              chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. Human miRNA genes are also
              present at fragile sites. A better understanding of genes and
              miRNAs lying in the fragile site regions and their association
              with disease progression is required. RESULT: HumCFS is a
              manually curated database of human chromosomal fragile sites.
              HumCFS provides useful information on fragile sites such as
              coordinates on the chromosome, cytoband, their chemical inducers
              and frequency of fragile site (rare or common), genes and miRNAs
              lying in fragile sites. Protein coding genes in the fragile sites
              were identified by mapping the coordinates of fragile sites with
              human genome Ensembl (GRCh38/hg38). Genes present in fragile
              sites were further mapped to DisGenNET database, to understand
              their possible link with human diseases. Human miRNAs from
              miRBase was also mapped on fragile site coordinates. In brief,
              HumCFS provides useful information about 125 human chromosomal
              fragile sites and their association with 4921 human
              protein-coding genes and 917 human miRNA's. CONCLUSION:
              User-friendly web-interface of HumCFS and hyper-linking with
              other resources will help researchers to search for genes, miRNAs
              efficiently and to intersect the relationship among them. For
              easy data retrieval and analysis, we have integrated standard
              web-based tools, such as JBrowse, BLAST etc. Also, the user can

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the mutational signatures underlying
              the somatic evolution of cancer, and the prevalences of

              intensity of positive selection that drives mutations to high
              frequency in tumors, yielding higher prevalences than expected on
              the basis of mutation and neutral drift alone. We apply this
              approach to a sample of 525 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
              exomes, producing a rank-ordered list of gene variants by
              selection intensity. Our results illustrate the complementarity
              of calculating the intensity of selection on mutations along with
              tallying the prevalence of individual substitutions in cancer:
              while many of the most prevalently-altered genes were heavily
              selected, their relative importance to the cancer phenotype
              differs from their prevalence and from their P value, with some
              infrequent variants exhibiting evidence of strong positive
              selection. Furthermore, we extend our analysis of effect size by
              quantifying the degree to which mutational processes (such as
              APOBEC mutagenesis) contributes mutations that are highly
              selected, driving head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We
              calculate the substitutions caused by APOBEC mutagenesis that

              bases at two sites whose mutant states are subject to high net
              realized selection intensities-PIK3CA E545K and E542K. By

              c-myc oncogene, 3 cell lines showed an 80- to 130-fold
              amplification of N-myc oncogene, and one cell line had a
              simultaneous amplification of the c-myb and N-myc oncogene. In
              this cell line both oncogenes were transcriptionally highly
              active at the same time. A variant subpopulation of SCLC
              expressed an 8.5-kilobase v-fms homologous transcript at high
              levels but without amplification of the c-fms gene. All cell
              lines examined had similar RNA levels of the N-ras, Ki-ras,

              rearrangements (CGRs). Although the underlying mechanisms are not
              well understood, CGRs have been implicated in tumorigenesis.
              Here, we introduce CouGaR, a novel method for characterizing the
              genomic structure of amplified CGRs, leveraging both depth of
              coverage (DOC) and discordant pair-end mapping techniques. We
              applied our method to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas and identify amplified CGRs in at least
              5.2\% (10+ copies) to 17.8\% (6+ copies) of the samples.
              Furthermore, ∼95\% of these amplified CGRs contain genes
              previously implicated in tumorigenesis, indicating the importance
              and widespread occurrence of CGRs in cancers. Additionally,
              CouGaR identified the occurrence of 'chromoplexy' in nearly 63\%
              of all prostate cancer samples and 30\% of all bladder cancer
              samples. To further validate the accuracy of our method, we
              experimentally tested 17 predicted fusions in two pediatric
              glioma samples and validated 15 of these (88\%) with precise
              resolution of the breakpoints via qPCR experiments and Sanger
              sequencing, with nearly perfect copy count concordance.
              Additionally, to further help display and understand the
              structure of CGRs, we have implemented CouGaR-viz, a generic

              inversions and translocations of DNA segments, is a major source
              of genetic variability in somatic cells and can dysregulate
              cancer-related pathways. However, discovering somatic SVs in
              single cells has been challenging, with copy-number-neutral and
              complex variants typically escaping detection. Here we describe
              single-cell tri-channel processing (scTRIP), a computational
              framework that integrates read depth, template strand and
              haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual
              cells. We surveyed SV landscapes of 565 single cells, including
              transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic
              samples, to discover abundant SV classes, including inversions,
              translocations and complex DNA rearrangements. Analysis of the
              leukemic samples revealed four times more somatic SVs than
              cytogenetic karyotyping, submicroscopic copy-number alterations,
              oncogenic copy-neutral rearrangements and a subclonal
              chromothripsis event. Advancing current methods, single-cell
              tri-channel processing can directly measure SV mutational
              processes in individual cells, such as breakage-fusion-bridge
              cycles, facilitating studies of clonal evolution, genetic
              mosaicism and SV formation mechanisms, which could improve

              Strand-coordinated clusters of mutated cytosines or guanines

              integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their
              matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the

              resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute
              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect
              patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations,
              structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection

              changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40\% of
              samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and
              increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy
              number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to
              simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

The expansion of genetically distinct sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance, and if so, would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively quantifying tumour heterogeneity have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and cascading genomic rearrangements. To address these challenges, we present MEDICC, a method for phylogenetic reconstruction and heterogeneity quantification based on a Minimum Event Distance for Intra-tumour Copy-number Comparisons. Using a transducer-based pairwise comparison function, we determine optimal phasing of major and minor alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in reconstruction accuracy, and additionally allows unbiased numerical quantification of tumour heterogeneity. Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential to understand the functional consequences of tumour heterogeneity. The MEDICC algorithms are independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both next-generation sequencing and array CGH data.},

Here, to decode this complexity, we derived copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of 117 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases, which were validated on 527 independent cases. We show that HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in known patterns of genomic aberration. Copy number signature exposures at diagnosis predict both overall survival and the probability of platinum-resistant relapse. Measurement of signature exposures provides a rational framework to choose combination treatments that target multiple mutational processes.},

  abstract = {The cancer genome is moulded by the dual processes of somatic mutation and selection. Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11\% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery. Two Articles in this issue add major data sets to the growing picture of the cancer genome. Bignell et al. analysed a large number of homozygous gene deletions in a collection of 746 publicly available cancer cell lines. Combined with information about hemizygous deletions of the same genes, the data suggest that many deletions found in cancer reflect the position of a gene at a fragile site in the genome, rather than as a recessive cancer gene whose loss confers a selective growth advantage. Beroukhim et al. present the largest data set to date on somatic copy-number variations across more than 3,000 specimens of human primary cancers. Many alterations are shared between multiple tumour types. Functional experiments demonstrate an oncogenic role for the apoptosis genes MCL1 and BCL2L1 that are associated with amplifications found in many cancers. Homozygous gene deletions in cancer cells occur over recessive cancer genes (where they can confer selective growth advantage) or over genes at fragile sites of the genome (where they are thought to reflect increased DNA breakage). Here, a large number of homozygous deletions in a collection of cancer cell lines are identified and analysed to derive structural signatures for the two different types of deletion. More deletions are found in inherently fragile regions, and fewer overlying recessive genes.},

Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2\%–3\% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25\% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.},

We have used this technique to examine 243 breast tumors from two separate studies for which detailed clinical data were available. The very high resolution of this technology has enabled us to identify three characteristic patterns of genomic copy number variation in diploid tumors and to measure correlations with patient survival. One of these patterns is characterized by multiple closely spaced amplicons, or “firestorms,” limited to single chromosome arms. These multiple amplifications are highly correlated with aggressive disease and poor survival even when the rest of the genome is relatively quiet. Analysis of a selected subset of clinical material suggests that a simple genomic calculation, based on the number and proximity of genomic alterations, correlates with life-table estimates of the probability of overall survival in patients with primary breast cancer. Based on this sample, we generate the working hypothesis that copy number profiling might provide information useful in making clinical decisions, especially regarding the use or not of systemic therapies (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy), in the management of operable primary breast cancer with ostensibly good prognosis, for example, small, node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive diploid cases.}},

We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term “chromoplexy,” frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.},

Because intercellular heterogeneity is often found in neoplastic tissues, we investigated the occurrence of BFB events in human solid tumors. Evidence of frequent BFB events was found in malignancies that showed unspecific chromosome aberrations, including ring chromosomes, dicentric chromosomes, and telomeric associations, as well as extensive intratumor heterogeneity in the pattern of structural changes but not in tumors with tumor-specific aberrations and low variability. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that chromosomes participating in anaphase bridge formation were involved in a significantly higher number of structural aberrations than other chromosomes. Tumors with BFB events showed a decreased elimination rate of unstable chromosome aberrations after irradiation compared with normal cells and other tumor cells. This result suggests that a combination of mitotically unstable chromosomes and an elevated tolerance to chromosomal damage leads to constant genomic reorganization in many malignancies, thereby providing a flexible genetic system for clonal evolution and progression.},

B/F/B cycles have been associated with low-copy gene amplification in human cancer cells, and have been proposed to be an initiating event in high-copy gene amplification. We have found that spontaneous telomere loss on a marker chromosome 16 in a human tumor cell line results in sister chromatid fusion and prolonged periods of chromosome instability. The high rate of anaphase bridges involving chromosome 16 demonstrates that this instability results from B/F/B cycles. The amplification of subtelomeric DNA on the marker chromosome provides conclusive evidence that B/F/B cycles initiated by spontaneous telomere loss are a mechanism for gene amplification in human cancer cells.},

Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer.

By combining extensive CFS molecular mapping and a comprehensive analysis of CFS features, we show that the pool of CFSs for all human cell types consists of chromosome regions with genes over 300 kb long, and different subsets of these loci are committed to fragility in different cell types. Interestingly, we find that transcription of large genes does not dictate CFS fragility. We further demonstrate that, like CFSs, cancer deletions are significantly enriched in genes over 300 kb long. We now provide evidence that over 50\% of recurrent cancer deletions originate from CFSs associated with large genes.},

These hotspots may be sites of selective susceptibility to double-strand-break damage due to high transcriptional activity or, through incrementally increasing copy number, may be sites of secondary selective pressure. The transcriptomic consequences ranged from strong individual oncogene effects to weak but quantifiable multigene expression effects.

Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations1, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape1,2,3,4,5. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific6,7. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.},

By analyzing \textbackslashtextasciitilde1,000 breast cancer samples, we confirmed this association and established that germline nonsense and frameshift variants in PALB2, but not in ATM or CHEK2, can also give rise to the same signature. We were able to accurately classify missense BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants known to impair homologous recombination (HR) on the basis of this signature. Finally, we show that epigenetic silencing of RAD51C and BRCA1 by promoter methylation is strongly associated with signature 3 and, in our data set, was highly enriched in basal-like breast cancers in young individuals of African descent.},

Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements. Video Abstract},

Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7\% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions.

  abstract = {Telomere crisis occurs during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve leads to frequent telomere fusions. The resulting dicentric chromosomes have been proposed to drive genome instability. Here, we examine the fate of dicentric human chromosomes in telomere crisis. We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into 50–200 μm chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3–20 hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3′ nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis.},

Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. The connection between DNA replication timing and changes that occur to the epigenome in cancer are still poorly understood.

However, our understanding of the earliest phases of colorectal neoplastic changes—which may occur in morphologically normal tissue—is comparatively limited, as for most cancer types. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to analyse hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed; some of these were ubiquitous and continuous, whereas others were only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during certain periods of life. Probable driver mutations were present in around 1\% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium. Colorectal cancers exhibit substantially increased mutational burdens relative to normal cells. Sequencing normal colorectal cells provides quantitative insights into the genomic and clonal evolution of cancer. Genome sequencing of hundreds of normal colonic crypts from 42 individuals sheds light on mutational processes and driver mutations in normal colorectal epithelial cells.},

  abstract = {The most common causes of chronic liver disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes1–7. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures8, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100–500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher mutational burden than normal liver. Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1–5\% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic liver disease; and others—arising from exogenous exposures—were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic liver, but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of liver tissue as it progresses from health to disease. Whole-genome sequencing of liver microdissections from five healthy individuals and nine with cirrhosis demonstrates the effects of liver disease on the genome, including increased rates of mutation, complex structural variation and different mutational signatures.},

To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed “kataegis,” was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. PaperClip},

Within breast cancer, the HER2-enriched subtype was clearly enriched for tumors with the APOBEC mutation pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis is functionally linked with cancer development.

Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour–normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity.

  abstract = {We analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers to advance understanding of the driver mutations conferring clonal advantage and the mutational processes generating somatic mutations. We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Approximately 1–5\% of breast cancers are attributed to inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and are selectively sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In other cancer types, germline and/or somatic mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) also confer selective sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Thus, assays to detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors have been sought. Recently, somatic substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement patterns, or 'mutational signatures', were associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction. Herein we used a lasso logistic regression model to identify six distinguishing mutational signatures predictive of BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. A weighted model called HRDetect was developed to accurately detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient samples. HRDetect identifies BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors with 98.7\% sensitivity (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). Application of this model in a cohort of 560 individuals with breast cancer, of whom 22 were known to carry a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, allowed us to identify an additional 22 tumors with somatic loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 47 tumors with functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency where no mutation was detected. We validated HRDetect on independent cohorts of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and demonstrated its efficacy in alternative sequencing strategies. Integrating all of the classes of mutational signatures thus reveals a larger proportion of individuals with breast cancer harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency (up to 22\%) than hitherto appreciated (∼1–5\%) who could have selective therapeutic sensitivity to PARP inhibition.},

We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.},

Here we define the mechanism underlying this rearrangement signature. We show that, in primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus–Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with \textbackslashtextasciitilde10 kilobase tandem duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.},

We devised a robust genomic metric able to identify cancers with a chromotype called tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) characterized by frequent and distributed tandem duplications (TDs). Enriched only in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in ovarian, endometrial, and liver cancers, TDP tumors conjointly exhibit tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, disruption of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), and increased expression of DNA replication genes pointing at rereplication in a defective checkpoint environment as a plausible causal mechanism. The resultant TDs in TDP augment global oncogene expression and disrupt tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, the TDP strongly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in both TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts. We conclude that the TDP is a common cancer chromotype that coordinately alters oncogene/tumor suppressor expression with potential as a marker for chemotherapeutic response.},

Generation of ssDNA from a double-strand break (DSB) requires nucleolytic degradation of the 5′-terminated strands to generate 3′-ssDNA tails, a process referred to as 5′–3′ end resection. The RecBCD helicase–nuclease complex is the main end-processing machine in Gram-negative bacteria. Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 can play a direct role in end resection in archaea and eukaryota, respectively, by removing end-blocking lesions and act indirectly by recruiting the helicases and nucleases responsible for extensive resection. In eukaryotic cells, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical regulatory step to differentiate between homology-dependent and end-joining repair of DSBs.},

Compared with short-fragment sequencing, GROC-SVs substantially improves the specificity of breakpoint detection at comparable sensitivity. This approach also performs sequence assembly across multiple breakpoints simultaneously, enabling the reconstruction of events exhibiting remarkable complexity. We show that chromothriptic rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and that rates of single-nucleotide variants and SVs are not correlated.

As such, karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively to discover novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at single-base-pair resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently, whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of monoallelic expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from paired tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes of these tumors using RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific expression. We show that the majority of monoallelic expression in the transcriptomes of triple-negative breast cancer can be explained by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper bound for monoallelic expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific modifications such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumors.}},

Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups—EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations.

Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.},

These genomes include at least 5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has accelerated by about 5\% in non-Africans compared to Africans since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that of other non-Africans.},

We describe SvABA, an efficient and accurate method for detecting SVs from short-read sequencing data using genome-wide local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We evaluated SvABA's performance on the NA12878 human genome and in simulated and real cancer genomes. SvABA demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity across a large spectrum of SVs and substantially improves detection performance for variants in the 20-300 bp range, compared with existing methods. SvABA also identifies complex somatic rearrangements with chains of short (<1000 bp) templated-sequence insertions copied from distant genomic regions. We applied SvABA to 344 cancer genomes from 11 cancer types and found that short templated-sequence insertions occur in ∼4\% of all somatic rearrangements. Finally, we demonstrate that SvABA can identify sites of viral integration and cancer driver alterations containing medium-sized (50-300 bp) SVs.},

The core of the neochromosome is amplified, rearranged, and corroded through hundreds of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Under selective pressure, amplified oncogenes are overexpressed, while coamplified passenger genes may be silenced epigenetically. New material may be captured during punctuated chromothriptic events. Centromeric corrosion leads to crisis, which is resolved through neocentromere formation or native centromere capture. Finally, amplification terminates, and the neochromosome core is stabilized in linear form by telomere capture.

We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway.

A natural extension of this hypothesis is that the clonal expansion must be driven by alteration of genes at recombination breakpoints whose altered functions actually drive clonal expansion. Nevertheless, when the FHIT gene was discovered at FRA3B, the most active common chromosome fragile region, and proposed as an example of a tumor suppressor gene altered by chromosome translocations and deletions, a wave of reports suggested that the FHIT gene was altered in cancer simply because it was in a fragile region and not because it had contributed to the clonal expansion, thus turning the original hypothesis upside down. Now, after nearly ten years and more than 500 FHIT reports, it is apparent that FHIT is an important tumor suppressor gene and that there are genes at other fragile regions that contribute significantly to development of cancer. A second fragile gene with a demonstrated role in cancer development is the WWOX gene on chromosome 16q; alterations to the WWOX gene contribute to development of hormone responsive and other cancers. Results of our recent studies of these two fragile tumor suppressor genes were summarized at the first Fragilome meeting in Heidelberg, Feb. 2005.},

Many CFSs are enriched with AT-dinucleotide rich sequences (AT-DRSs) which have the potential to form stable secondary structures upon unwinding the double helix during DNA replication. These stable structures can potentially perturb DNA replication progression, leading to genomic instability. Using site-specific targeting system, we show that targeted integration of a 3.4 kb AT-DRS derived from the human CFS FRA16C into a chromosomally stable region within the human genome is able to drive fragile site formation under conditions of replication stress. Analysis of >1300 X chromosomes integrated with the 3.4 kb AT-DRS revealed recurrent gaps and breaks at the integration site. DNA sequences derived from the integrated AT-DRS showed in vitro a significantly increased tendency to fold into branched secondary structures, supporting the predicted mechanism of instability. Our findings clearly indicate that intrinsic DNA features, such as complexed repeated sequence motifs, predispose the human genome to chromosomal instability.},

A powerful way to discover cancer-causing genes is to identify genomic regions that show recurrent copy-number alterations (gains and losses) in tumor genomes. Recent advances in sequencing technologies suggest that massively parallel sequencing may provide a feasible alternative to DNA microarrays for detecting copy-number alterations. Here we present: (i) a statistical analysis of the power to detect copy-number alterations of a given size; (ii) SegSeq, an algorithm to segment equal copy numbers from massively parallel sequence data; and (iii) analysis of experimental data from three matched pairs of tumor and normal cell lines. We show that a collection of ∼14 million aligned sequence reads from human cell lines has comparable power to detect events as the current generation of DNA microarrays and has over twofold better precision for localizing breakpoints (typically, to within ∼1 kilobase).},

According to information available from human genome browsers aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication induces 77 of 88 known common FS. However, in the literature additional FS are reported, which are also, at least in part, inducible by aphidicolin. To the best of our knowledge, here we present the first and largest ever done systematic, whole genome-directed and comprehensive screening for aphidicolin-inducible breakage-prone regions. The study was performed on stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of 3 unrelated healthy individuals. Twenty-five thousand metaphase spreads were analyzed and overall 22,537 FS located in 230 different loci were recorded. Sixty-one of those FS were never observed before and 52 were already previously reported but not included in genome browsers and yet verified. Interestingly, aphidicolin was able to induce all types of rare and common FS, suggesting that these breakage-prone regions are less dependent on the inducing chemicals than originally supposed. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive genome wide map for FS and studied possible correlations of chromosome length and GTG-banding level with FS-frequency. To handle FS better in future, an extension of the already existing alphabetical nomenclature for FS on single chromosomes is suggested.},

  abstract = {Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFSs) are unstable genomic regions that break under replication stress and are involved in structural variation. They frequently are sites of chromosomal rearrangements in cancer and of viral integration. However, CFSs are undercharacterized at the molecular level and thus difficult to predict computationally. Newly available genome-wide profiling studies provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to associate CFSs with features of their local genomic contexts. Here, we contrasted the genomic landscape of cytogenetically defined aphidicolin-induced CFSs (aCFSs) to that of nonfragile sites, using multiple logistic regression. We also analyzed aCFS breakage frequencies as a function of their genomic landscape, using standard multiple regression. We show that local genomic features are effective predictors both of regions harboring aCFSs (explaining ∼81\% of the deviance in logistic regression models) and of aCFS breakage frequencies (explaining ∼45\% of the variance in standard regression models). In our optimal models (based on a combination of biological interpretability and high R-squared value), aCFSs are predominantly located in G-negative chromosomal bands and away from centromeres, are enriched in Alu repeats, and have high DNA flexibility. In alternative models, CpG island density, H3K4me1 coverage, and mononucleotide microsatellite coverage are significant predictors. Also, aCFSs have high fragility when colocated with evolutionarily conserved chromosomal breakpoints. Our models are predictive of the fragility of aCFSs mapped at a higher resolution. Importantly, the genomic features we identified here as significant predictors of fragility allow us to draw valuable inferences on the molecular mechanisms underlying aCFSs.},

  abstract = {The development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened the door to novel methods for detecting copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome. While in the past CNVs have been detected based on array CGH data, recent studies have shown that depth-of-coverage information from HTS technologies can also be used for the reliable identification of large copy-variable regions. Such methods, however, are hindered by sequencing biases that lead certain regions of the genome to be over- or undersampled, lowering their resolution and ability to accurately identify the exact breakpoints of the variants. In this work, we develop a method for CNV detection that supplements the depth-of-coverage with paired-end mapping information, where mate pairs mapping discordantly to the reference serve to indicate the presence of variation. Our algorithm, called CNVer, combines this information within a unified computational framework called the donor graph, allowing us to better mitigate the sequencing biases that cause uneven local coverage and accurately predict CNVs. We use CNVer to detect 4879 CNVs in the recently described genome of a Yoruban individual. Most of the calls (77\%) coincide with previously known variants within the Database of Genomic Variants, while 81\% of deletion copy number variants previously known for this individual coincide with one of our loss calls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CNVer can reconstruct the absolute copy counts of segments of the donor genome and evaluate the feasibility of using CNVer with low coverage datasets.},

  abstract = {Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) is a mechanism of genomic instability characterized by the joining and subsequent tearing apart of sister chromatids. When this process is repeated during multiple rounds of cell division, it leads to patterns of copy number increases of chromosomal segments as well as fold-back inversions where duplicated segments are arranged head-to-head. These structural variations can then drive tumorigenesis. BFB can be observed in progress using cytogenetic techniques, but generally BFB must be inferred from data such as microarrays or sequencing collected after BFB has ceased. Making correct inferences from this data is not straightforward, particularly given the complexity of some cancer genomes and BFB’s ability to generate a wide range of rearrangement patterns. Here we present algorithms to aid the interpretation of evidence for BFB. We first pose the BFB count-vector problem: given a chromosome segmentation and segment copy numbers, decide whether BFB can yield a chromosome with the given segment counts. We present a linear time algorithm for the problem, in contrast to a previous exponential time algorithm. We then combine this algorithm with fold-back inversions to develop tests for BFB. We show that, contingent on assumptions about cancer genome evolution, count vectors and fold-back inversions are sufficient evidence for detecting BFB. We apply the presented techniques to paired-end sequencing data from pancreatic tumors and confirm a previous finding of BFB as well as identify a chromosomal region likely rearranged by BFB cycles, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.},

  abstract = {Recent reports have demonstrated that oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a frequent event in cancer, providing new momentum to explore a phenomenon first discovered several decades ago. The direct consequence of ecDNA gains in these cases is an increase in DNA copy number of the oncogenes residing on the extrachromosomal element. A secondary effect, perhaps even more important, is that the unequal segregation of ecDNA from a parental tumour cell to offspring cells rapidly increases tumour heterogeneity, thus providing the tumour with an additional array of responses to microenvironment-induced and therapy-induced stress factors and perhaps providing an evolutionary advantage. This Perspectives article discusses the current knowledge and potential implications of oncogene amplification on ecDNA in cancer. The existence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer was first described decades ago, but recent reports of oncogene amplification on ecDNA have reinvigorated interest in this field.

The latest release, COSMIC v86 (August 2018), includes almost 6 million coding mutations across 1.4 million tumour samples, curated from over 26 000 publications. In addition to coding mutations, COSMIC covers all the genetic mechanisms by which somatic mutations promote cancer, including non-coding mutations, gene fusions, copy-number variants and drug-resistance mutations. COSMIC is primarily hand-curated, ensuring quality, accuracy and descriptive data capture. Building on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new initiatives that allow us to prioritize key genes and diseases, and to react more quickly and comprehensively to new findings in the literature. Alongside improvements to the public website and data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein structures, their protein structural and functional impacts, and implications for druggability. In parallel with COSMIC’s deep and broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) describes a curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer. Currently describing 719 genes, the CGC has recently introduced functional descriptions of how each gene drives disease, summarized into the 10 cancer Hallmarks.},

We found that while p53 −/− lymphoblastic T cells harbor primarily ectopic DNA deletions, Rag2 −/− p53 −/− T cell lymphomas display complex genomic rearrangements associated with amplification of the chromosomal location 9qA4-5.3. We show that this amplicon is generated by breakage-fusion-bridge during mitosis and arises distinctly in T cell lymphomas originating from an early progenitor stage. Notably, we report amplification of the corresponding syntenic region (11q23) in a subset of human leukemia leading to the overexpression of several cancer genes, including MLL/KMT2A. Our findings provide direct evidence that lymphocytes undergo malignant transformation through distinct genome architectural routes that are determined by both RAG-dependent and RAG-independent DNA damage and a block in cell development.},

ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination, but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known. Recently, mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers, pediatric glioblastomas, and other tumors of the central nervous system, suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers. We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic, molecular biological, and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines, including cell lines derived in vitro. Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT–immortalized cell lines. In addition, ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements, marked micronucleation, defects in the G2/M checkpoint, and altered double-strand break (DSB) repair. These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers.},

  abstract = {{A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes1–7. Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act. Whole-genome sequencing data from more than 2,500 cancers of 38 tumour types reveal 16 signatures that can be used to classify somatic structural variants, highlighting the diversity of genomic rearrangements in cancer.}},

Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ variants in protein-coding genes. Exome sequencing data from 60,706 people of diverse geographic ancestry is presented, providing insight into genetic variation across populations, and illuminating the relationship between DNA variants and human disease. As part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) project, Daniel MacArthur and colleagues report on the generation and analysis of high-quality exome sequencing data from 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestry.

This Analysis uses the published literature to form a DNA damage response network and then uses this to identify potential synthetic lethal interactions and to assess the druggability of proteins in the DNA damage response network. The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential for maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell, and its disruption is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Classically, defects in the DDR have been exploited therapeutically in the treatment of cancer with radiation therapies or genotoxic chemotherapies. More recently, protein components of the DDR systems have been identified as promising avenues for targeted cancer therapeutics. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the function, role in cancer and therapeutic potential of 450 expert-curated human DDR genes. We discuss the DDR drugs that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or that are under clinical investigation. We examine large-scale genomic and expression data for 15 cancers to identify deregulated components of the DDR, and we apply systematic computational analysis to identify DDR proteins that are amenable to modulation by small molecules, highlighting potential novel therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge
              of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains
              challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust
              preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of
              human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological
              annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line
              Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression,
              chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data
              from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with
              pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of
              the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of
              genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug
              sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that
              plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor
              inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor
              efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted
              sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results
              indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to
              enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents.
              The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the
              preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical

  abstract = {Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a poor-prognosis cancer type with rapidly rising incidence. Understanding of the genetic events driving EAC development is limited, and there are few molecular biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutics. Using a cohort of 551 genomically characterized EACs with matched RNA sequencing data, we discovered 77 EAC driver genes and 21 noncoding driver elements. We identified a mean of 4.4 driver events per tumor, which were derived more commonly from mutations than copy number alterations, and compared the prevelence of these mutations to the exome-wide mutational excess calculated using non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios (dN/dS). We observed mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between several dysregulated EAC pathways, a result suggestive of strong functional relationships. Indicators of poor prognosis (SMAD4 and GATA4) were verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value. Over 50\% of EACs contained sensitizing events for CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which were highly correlated with clinically relevant sensitivity in a panel of EAC cell lines and organoids. Genomic analysis of 551 esophageal adenocarcinomas identifies new driver mutations and biomarkers associated with poor prognosis. More than 50\% of esophageal adenocarcinomas contain sensitizing events for CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors, thus providing an evidence base for targeted therapeutics.},

              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with

              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x

  abstract = {The identification of genomic rearrangements with high
              sensitivity and specificity using massively parallel sequencing
              remains a major challenge, particularly in precision medicine and
              cancer research. Here, we describe a new method for detecting
              rearrangements, GRIDSS (Genome Rearrangement IDentification
              Software Suite). GRIDSS is a multithreaded structural variant
              (SV) caller that performs efficient genome-wide break-end
              assembly prior to variant calling using a novel positional de
              Bruijn graph-based assembler. By combining assembly, split read,
              and read pair evidence using a probabilistic scoring, GRIDSS
              achieves high sensitivity and specificity on simulated, cell
              line, and patient tumor data, recently winning SV subchallenge
              \#5 of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM8.5 Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge.
              On human cell line data, GRIDSS halves the false discovery rate
              compared to other recent methods while matching or exceeding
              their sensitivity. GRIDSS identifies nontemplate sequence
              insertions, microhomologies, and large imperfect homologies,
              estimates a quality score for each breakpoint, stratifies calls
              into high or low confidence, and supports multisample analysis.},

              characterizing naturally occurring variation and for
              understanding pathological somatic rearrangements in personal
              genome sequencing data. Of particular interest are integrated
              methods that accurately identify simple and complex
              rearrangements in heterogeneous sequencing datasets at
              single-nucleotide resolution, as an optimal basis for
              investigating the formation mechanisms and functional
              consequences of SVs. RESULTS: We have developed an SV discovery
              method, called DELLY, that integrates short insert paired-ends,
              long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments to accurately
              delineate genomic rearrangements at single-nucleotide resolution.
              DELLY is suitable for detecting copy-number variable deletion and
              tandem duplication events as well as balanced rearrangements such
              as inversions or reciprocal translocations. DELLY, thus, enables
              to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic rearrangements,
              including complex events. On simulated data, DELLY compares
              favorably to other SV prediction methods across a wide range of

              from the 1000 Genomes Project and cancer genomes, and validation

  abstract = {SUMMARY: More and more cancer studies use next-generation
              sequencing (NGS) data to detect various types of genomic
              variation. However, even when researchers have such data at hand,
              single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays have been considered
              necessary to assess copy number alterations and especially loss
              of heterozygosity (LOH). Here, we present the tool Control-FREEC
              that enables automatic calculation of copy number and allelic
              content profiles from NGS data, and consequently predicts regions
              of genomic alteration such as gains, losses and LOH. Taking as
              input aligned reads, Control-FREEC constructs copy number and
              B-allele frequency profiles. The profiles are then normalized,
              segmented and analyzed in order to assign genotype status (copy
              number and allelic content) to each genomic region. When a
              matched normal sample is provided, Control-FREEC discriminates
              somatic from germline events. Control-FREEC is able to analyze
              overdiploid tumor samples and samples contaminated by normal
              cells. Low mappability regions can be excluded from the analysis
              using provided mappability tracks. AVAILABILITY: C++ source code

                 disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic point
                 mutations, whereas computational methods targeting

              hybridization has been used widely to identify CNVs genome wide,
              but the next-generation sequencing technology provides an
              opportunity to characterize CNVs genome wide with unprecedented
              resolution. In this study, we developed an algorithm to detect
              CNVs from whole-genome sequencing data and applied it to a newly
              sequenced glioblastoma genome with a matched control. This
              read-depth algorithm, called BIC-seq, can accurately and
              efficiently identify CNVs via minimizing the Bayesian information
              criterion. Using BIC-seq, we identified hundreds of CNVs as small
              as 40 bp in the cancer genome sequenced at 10$\times$ coverage,
              whereas we could only detect large CNVs (> 15 kb) in the array
              comparative genomic hybridization profiles for the same genome.
              Eighty percent (14/16) of the small variants tested (110 bp to 14
              kb) were experimentally validated by quantitative PCR,
              demonstrating high sensitivity and true positive rate of the
              algorithm. We also extended the algorithm to detect recurrent
              CNVs in multiple samples as well as deriving error bars for
              breakpoints using a Gibbs sampling approach. We propose this
              statistical approach as a principled yet practical and efficient

              chromothripsis involving chromosome 12. The core of the
              neochromosome is amplified, rearranged, and corroded through
              hundreds of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Under selective

              receptor 1 (PD-1) are considered front-line therapy in metastatic
              melanoma. The efficacy of PD-1 blockade for patients with
              biologically distinct melanomas arising from acral and mucosal
              surfaces has not been well described. METHODS: A
              multi-institutional, retrospective cohort analysis identified
              adults with advanced acral and mucosal melanoma who received
              treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab as standard clinical
              practice through expanded access programs or published
              prospective trials. Objective responses were determined using
              investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
              Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Progression-free survival and
              overall survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
              RESULTS: Sixty individuals were identified, including 25 (42\%)
              with acral melanoma and 35 (58\%) with mucosal melanoma.
              Fifty-one patients (85\%) had received previous therapy,
              including 77\% who had previously received ipilimumab. Forty
              patients (67\%) received pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10
              mg/kg, and 20 (33\%) received nivolumab at a doses ranging from
              0.3 to 10 mg/kg every 2 to 3 weeks. The objective response rate
              was 32\% (95\% confidence interval, 15\%-54\%) in patients with
              acral melanoma and 23\% (95\% confidence interval, 10\%-40\%) in
              those with mucosal melanoma. After a median follow-up of 20
              months in the acral melanoma group and 10.6 months in the mucosal
              melanoma group, the median progression-free survival was 4.1
              months and 3.9 months, respectively. Only 2 patients (3\%)
              discontinued treatment because of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Response
              rates to PD-1 blockade in patients with acral and mucosal
              melanomas were comparable to the published rates in patients with
              cutaneous melanoma and support the routine use of PD-1 blockade
              in clinical practice. Further investigation is needed to identify

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze a glioblastoma tumor specimen with 3
              different platforms and compare potentially actionable calls from
              each. METHODS: Tumor DNA was analyzed by a commercial targeted
              panel. In addition, tumor-normal DNA was analyzed by whole-genome
              sequencing (WGS) and tumor RNA was analyzed by RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq). The WGS and RNA-seq data were analyzed by a team of
              bioinformaticians and cancer oncologists, and separately by IBM
              Watson Genomic Analytics (WGA), an automated system for
              prioritizing somatic variants and identifying drugs. RESULTS:
              More variants were identified by WGS/RNA analysis than by
              targeted panels. WGA completed a comparable analysis in a
              fraction of the time required by the human analysts. CONCLUSIONS:
              The development of an effective human-machine interface in the
              analysis of deep cancer genomic datasets may provide potentially
              clinically actionable calls for individual patients in a more

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Findings based on recent advances in next-generation
              sequence analysis suggest that, in some tumors, a single
              catastrophic event, termed chromothripsis, results in several
              simultaneous tumorigenic alterations. Previous studies have
              suggested that glioblastoma (GBM) may exhibit chromothripsis at a
              higher rate (39\%) than other tumors (9\%). Primary glioblastoma
              is an aggressive form of brain cancer that typically appears
              suddenly in older adults. With aggressive treatment, the median
              survival time is only 15 months. Their acute onset and widespread
              genomic instability indicates that chromothripsis may play a key
              role in their initiation and progression. GBMs are often
              characterized by EGFR amplification, CDKN2A and PTEN deletion,
              although approximately 20\% of GBMs harbor additional
              amplifications in MDM2 or MDM4 with CDK4. METHODS: We used the
              chromothripsis prediction tool, Shatterproof, in conjunction with
              a custom whole genome sequence analysis pipeline in order to
              generate putative regions of chromothripsis. The data derived
              from this study was further expanded on using fluorescence in
              situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and susceptibility studies
              with colony formation assays. RESULTS: We show that primary GBMs
              are associated with higher chromothripsis scores and establish a
              link between chromothripsis and gene amplification of receptor
              tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as well as modulators of the TP53 and
              RB1 pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a newly introduced
              bioinformatic tool, we provide evidence that chromothripsis is
              associated with the formation of amplicons containing several
              oncogenes involved in key pathways that are likely essential for
              post-chromothriptic cell survival.},

              types, chromothripsis was found to be associated with poor
              prognosis. We performed mate-pair sequencing and analysis of
              structural rearrangements in 132 prostate cancer cases which
              included clinically insignificant Gleason score 6 tumors,
              clinically significant tumors of higher grade (7+) and high grade
              prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Chromothripsis was observed
              at least 30 per cent of the samples across different grades.
              Surprisingly, it was frequently observed in clinically
              insignificant Gleason score 6 tumors, indicating that
              chromothripsis does not define more aggressive phenotype. The
              degree of chromothripsis did not increase significantly in tumors
              of advanced grades and did not appear to contribute to tumor
              progression. Our data showed that distribution of chromothriptic
              rearrangements differed from that of fragile sites but correlated
              with the size of chromosomes. We also provided evidence that
              rearrangements resulting from chromothripsis were present in the
              cells of neighboring Gleason patterns of the same tumor. Our data

              sufficiently identify false-positive fusions arising during
              library preparation, sequencing, and alignment. Here, we
              introduce Data-Enriched Efficient PrEcise STatistical fusion
              detection (DEEPEST), an algorithm that uses statistical modeling
              to minimize false-positives while increasing the sensitivity of
              fusion detection. In 9,946 tumor RNA-sequencing datasets from The
              Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 33 tumor types, DEEPEST
              identifies 31,007 fusions, 30\% more than identified by other
              methods, while calling 10-fold fewer false-positive fusions in
              nontransformed human tissues. We leverage the increased precision
              of DEEPEST to discover fundamental cancer biology. Namely, 888
              candidate oncogenes are identified based on overrepresentation in
              DEEPEST calls, and 1,078 previously unreported fusions involving
              long intergenic noncoding RNAs, demonstrating a previously
              unappreciated prevalence and potential for function. DEEPEST also
              reveals a high enrichment for fusions involving oncogenes in
              cancers, including ovarian cancer, which has had minimal
              treatment advances in recent decades, finding that more than 50\%
              of tumors harbor gene fusions predicted to be oncogenic. Specific
              protein domains are enriched in DEEPEST calls, indicating a
              global selection for fusion functionality: kinase domains are
              nearly 2-fold more enriched in DEEPEST calls than expected by
              chance, as are domains involved in (anaerobic) metabolism and DNA
              binding. The statistical algorithms, population-level analytic
              framework, and the biological conclusions of DEEPEST call for
              increased attention to gene fusions as drivers of cancer and for
              future research into using fusions for targeted therapy.},
