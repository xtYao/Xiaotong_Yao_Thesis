               has been identified in only a few cases. Most of these
               rearrangements were stably transmitted, in an unbalanced form,
               from a healthy mother to her child with congenital abnormalities
               probably caused by de novo copy-number changes of dosage
               sensitive genes. We describe a G-CTH transmitted through three
               generations in 11 healthy carriers. METHODS: Conventional
               cytogenetic analysis, mate-pair sequencing, and polymerase chain
               reaction (PCR) were used to identify the chromosome
               rearrangement and characterize the breakpoints in all three
               generations. RESULTS: We identified an apparently balanced
               translocation t(3;5), later shown to be a G-CTH, in all
               individuals of a three-generation family. The G-CTH stably
               segregated without occurrence of additional rearrangements;
               however, several spontaneous abortions were reported, possibly
               due to unbalanced transmission. Although seven protein-coding
               genes are interrupted, no clinical features can be definitively
               attributed to the affected genes. However, it can be speculated
               that truncation of one of these genes, encoding
               ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR), a
               key component of the DNA damage response, may be related to
               G-CTH formation. CONCLUSION: G-CTH rearrangements are not always
               associated with abnormal phenotypes and may be misinterpreted as
               balanced two-way translocations, suggesting that G-CTH is an
               underdiagnosed phenomenon.Genet Med 18 5, 494-500.",

              identified in previous studies. We examine the spectrum of
              structural variants (SVs) instigated by natural telomere crisis.
              Eight spontaneous post-crisis clones did not show prominent
              patterns of BFB cycles or chromothripsis. Their crisis-induced
              genome rearrangements varied from infrequent simple SVs to more
              frequent and complex SVs. In contrast, BFB cycles and
              chromothripsis occurred in MRC5 fibroblast clones that escaped
              telomere crisis after CRISPR-controlled telomerase activation.
              This system revealed convergent evolutionary lineages altering
              one allele of chromosome 12p, where a short telomere likely
              predisposed to fusion. Remarkably, the 12p chromothripsis and BFB
              events were stabilized by independent fusions to chromosome 21.
              The data establish that telomere crisis can generate a wide
              spectrum of SVs implying that a lack of BFB patterns and
              chromothripsis in cancer genomes does not indicate absence of

              described in cancer, including overexpression2, altered splicing3

              underlying genomic changes owing to heterogeneity among patients
              and tumour types, and the relatively small cohorts of patients
              for whom samples have been analysed by both transcriptome and
              whole-genome sequencing. Here we present, to our knowledge, the
              most comprehensive catalogue of cancer-associated gene
              alterations to date, obtained by characterizing tumour
              transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of
              Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer
              Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)5.
              Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we associated several
              categories of RNA alterations with germline and somatic DNA
              alterations, and identified probable genetic mechanisms. Somatic
              copy-number alterations were the major drivers of variations in
              total gene and allele-specific expression. We identified 649
              associations of somatic single-nucleotide variants with gene
              expression in cis, of which 68.4\% involved associations with
              flanking non-coding regions of the gene. We found 1,900 splicing
              alterations associated with somatic mutations, including the
              formation of exons within introns in proximity to Alu elements.
              In addition, 82\% of gene fusions were associated with structural
              variants, including 75 of a new class, termed 'bridged' fusions,
              in which a third genomic location bridges two genes. We observed
              transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer
              types and have associations with variations in DNA mutational
              signatures. This compendium of RNA alterations in the genomic

              local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We
              evaluated SvABA's performance on the NA12878 human genome and in
              simulated and real cancer genomes. SvABA demonstrates superior
              sensitivity and specificity across a large spectrum of SVs and
              substantially improves detection performance for variants in the
              20-300 bp range, compared with existing methods. SvABA also
              identifies complex somatic rearrangements with chains of short
              (<1000 bp) templated-sequence insertions copied from distant
              genomic regions. We applied SvABA to 344 cancer genomes from 11
              cancer types and found that short templated-sequence insertions
              occur in ∼4\% of all somatic rearrangements. Finally, we
              demonstrate that SvABA can identify sites of viral integration
              and cancer driver alterations containing medium-sized (50-300 bp)
