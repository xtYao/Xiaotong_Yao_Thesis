  abstract  = "SummaryCancer genomes often harbor hundreds of somatic DNA
               rearrangement junctions, many of which cannot be easily
               classified into simple (e.g., deletion) or complex (e.g.,
               chromothripsis) structural variant classes. Applying a novel
               genome graph computational paradigm to analyze the topology of
               junction copy number (JCN) across 2,778 tumor whole-genome
               sequences, we uncovered three novel complex rearrangement
               phenomena: pyrgo, rigma, and tyfonas. Pyrgo are ``towers'' of
               low-JCN duplications associated with early-replicating regions,
               superenhancers, and breast or ovarian cancers. Rigma comprise
               ``chasms'' of low-JCN deletions enriched in late-replicating
               fragile sites and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Tyfonas are
               ``typhoons'' of high-JCN junctions and fold-back inversions
               associated with expressed protein-coding fusions, breakend
               hypermutation, and acral, but not cutaneous, melanomas.

  abstract = "Telomere crisis contributes to cancer genome evolution, yet only
              a subset of cancers display breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles
              and chromothripsis, hallmarks of experimental telomere crisis
              identified in previous studies. We examine the spectrum of
              structural variants (SVs) instigated by natural telomere crisis.
              Eight spontaneous post-crisis clones did not show prominent
              patterns of BFB cycles or chromothripsis. Their crisis-induced
              genome rearrangements varied from infrequent simple SVs to more
              frequent and complex SVs. In contrast, BFB cycles and
              chromothripsis occurred in MRC5 fibroblast clones that escaped
              telomere crisis after CRISPR-controlled telomerase activation.
              This system revealed convergent evolutionary lineages altering
              one allele of chromosome 12p, where a short telomere likely
              predisposed to fusion. Remarkably, the 12p chromothripsis and BFB
              events were stabilized by independent fusions to chromosome 21.
              The data establish that telomere crisis can generate a wide
              spectrum of SVs implying that a lack of BFB patterns and
              chromothripsis in cancer genomes does not indicate absence of
              past telomere crisis.",
