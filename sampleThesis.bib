  abstract = "Current therapies for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant
              childhood brain tumour, impose debilitating effects on the
              developing child, and highlight the need for molecularly targeted
              treatments with reduced toxicity. Previous studies have been
              unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and
              molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups.
              Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced
              medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among
              1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify
              subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously
              undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were
              confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and
              Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous
              knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched
              for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions
              that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate
              PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an

              biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive

              cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and

              comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic
              alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the

              structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline

              (SNVs), mobile element insertions, and structural changes in the
              DNA, is a common phenomenon in human brain cells, with potential
              functional consequences. Using a clonal approach, we previously
              detected 200-400 mosaic SNVs per cell in three human fetal brains
              (15-21 wk postconception). However, structural variation in the
              human fetal brain has not yet been investigated. Here, we
              discover and validate four mosaic structural variants (SVs) in
              the same brains and resolve their precise breakpoints. The SVs
              were of kilobase scale and complex, consisting of deletion(s) and
              rearranged genomic fragments, which sometimes originated from
              different chromosomes. Sequences at the breakpoints of these
              rearrangements had microhomologies, suggesting their origin from
              replication errors. One SV was found in two clones, and we timed
              its origin to ∼14 wk postconception. No large scale mosaic copy
              number variants (CNVs) were detectable in normal fetal human
              brains, suggesting that previously reported megabase-scale CNVs
              in neurons arise at later stages of development. By reanalysis of
              public single nuclei data from adult brain neurons, we detected
              an extrachromosomal circular DNA event. Our study reveals the
              existence of mosaic SVs in the developing human brain, likely
              arising from cell proliferation during mid-neurogenesis. Although
              relatively rare compared to SNVs and present in ∼10\% of neurons,
              SVs in developing human brain affect a comparable number of bases
              in the genome (∼6200 vs. ∼4000 bp), implying that they may have

              cancer, such as environmental exposures or DNA repair
              abnormalities, these mutations can form a specific pattern called
              a mutational signature. Many mutational signatures have already
              been reported in cancer, but by performing whole-genome
              sequencing on a particularly large collection of cancer samples,
              Degasperi et al. not only confirmed previously reported
              signatures, but also discovered many rarer ones (see the

              signatures, tried to elucidate the underlying biology where
              possible, and then provided an algorithm for applying these

              the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining
              proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
              cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
              angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
              these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the

              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.
              Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging
              hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of
              energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to
              cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity:
              they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells

               we generated 42,000 genomes from multi-year time-series
               single-cell whole-genome sequencing of breast epithelium and
               primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived
               xenografts (PDXs), revealing the nature of CNA-defined clonal
               fitness dynamics induced by TP53 mutation and cisplatin
               chemotherapy. Using a new Wright--Fisher population genetics
               model8,9 to infer clonal fitness, we found that TP53 mutation
               alters the fitness landscape, reproducibly distributing fitness
               over a larger number of clones associated with distinct CNAs.
               Furthermore, in TNBC PDX models with mutated TP53, inferred
               fitness coefficients from CNA-based genotypes accurately
               forecast experimentally enforced clonal competition dynamics.
               Drug treatment in three long-term serially passaged TNBC PDXs
               resulted in cisplatin-resistant clones emerging from low-fitness
               phylogenetic lineages in the untreated setting. Conversely,
               high-fitness clones from treatment-naive controls were
               eradicated, signalling an inversion of the fitness landscape.
               Finally, upon release of drug, selection pressure dynamics were
               reversed, indicating a fitness cost of treatment resistance.
               Together, our findings define clonal fitness linked to both CNA
               and therapeutic resistance in polyclonal tumours. Whole-genome
               sequencing of human cancer cells in patient-derived mouse

                 These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal
                 samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those
                 genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected
                 by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with
                 cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list
                 of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical
                 methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many
                 implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors
                 and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive
                 false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We
                 show that this problem stems largely from mutational
                 heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology,
                 MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to
                 exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover
                 extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum
                 within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes
                 and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the
                 genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
                 timing and also with transcriptional activity. By

              One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all
              the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the
              1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily.
              Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in
              tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations
              across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from
              neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals
              of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed
              bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in
              the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach
              combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many cancer genomes are extensively rearranged with
              highly aberrant chromosomal karyotypes. Structural and copy
              number variations in cancer genomes can be determined via
              abnormal mapping of sequenced reads to the reference genome.
              Recently it became possible to reconcile both of these types of
              large-scale variations into a karyotype graph representation of
              the rearranged cancer genomes. Such a representation, however,
              does not directly describe the linear and/or circular structure
              of the underlying rearranged cancer chromosomes, thus limiting
              possible analysis of cancer genomes somatic evolutionary process
              as well as functional genomic changes brought by the large-scale
              genome rearrangements. RESULTS: Here we address the
              aforementioned limitation by introducing a novel methodological
              framework for recovering rearranged cancer chromosomes from
              karyotype graphs. For a cancer karyotype graph we formulate an
              Eulerian Decomposition Problem (EDP) of finding a collection of
              linear and/or circular rearranged cancer chromosomes that are
              determined by the graph. We derive and prove computational
              complexities for several variations of the EDP. We then
              demonstrate that Eulerian decomposition of the cancer karyotype
              graphs is not always unique and present the Consistent Contig
              Covering Problem (CCCP) of recovering unambiguous cancer contigs
              from the cancer karyotype graph, and describe a novel algorithm
              CCR capable of solving CCCP in polynomial time. We apply CCR on a
              prostate cancer dataset and demonstrate that it is capable of
              consistently recovering large cancer contigs even when underlying
              cancer genomes are highly rearranged. CONCLUSIONS: CCR can
              recover rearranged cancer contigs from karyotype graphs thereby
              addressing existing limitation in inferring chromosomal

              diversity in somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) may provide
              the variation necessary for tumour evolution1,3,4. Here we use
              multi-sample phasing and SCNA analysis of 1,421 samples from 394
              tumours across 22 tumour types to show that continuous
              chromosomal instability results in pervasive SCNA heterogeneity.
              Parallel evolutionary events, which cause disruption in the same
              genes (such as BCL9, MCL1, ARNT (also known as HIF1B), TERT and
              MYC) within separate subclones, were present in 37\% of tumours.
              Most recurrent losses probably occurred before whole-genome
              doubling, that was found as a clonal event in 49\% of tumours.
              However, loss of heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen
              (HLA) locus and loss of chromosome 8p to a single haploid copy
              recurred at substantial subclonal frequencies, even in tumours

              chromosomal karyotypes. Deriving these karyotypes from
              high-throughput DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples is
              complicated because most tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of
              normal cells and subpopulations of cancer cells, or clones, that
              harbor distinct somatic mutations. We introduce a new algorithm,
              Reconstructing Cancer Karyotypes (RCK), to reconstruct
              haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer
              genomes from DNA sequencing data from a bulk tumor sample. RCK
              leverages evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutational
              process in cancer to reduce ambiguity in the deconvolution of
              admixed sequencing data into multiple haplotype-specific cancer

              Alterations (CNAs) can be inferred from short-read sequencing
              data, enabling genomics-based precision oncology. Emerging
              Nanopore sequencing technologies offer the potential for broader
              clinical utility, for example in smaller hospitals, due to lower
              instrument cost, higher portability, and ease of use.
              Nonetheless, Nanopore sequencing devices are limited in terms of
              the number of retrievable sequencing reads/molecules compared to
              short-read sequencing platforms. This represents a challenge for
              applications that require high read counts such as CNA inference.
              To address this limitation, we targeted the sequencing of
              short-length DNA molecules loaded at optimized concentration in
              an effort to increase sequence read/molecule yield from a single

              The data shows that, compared to traditional approaches such as
              chromosome analysis/cytogenetics, short molecule nanopore

Cells continuously rewire their metabolic networks in response to changes in environmental conditions to sustain fitness. Studies of the systemic properties of metabolic networks give insight into metabolic plasticity and robustness, and the ability of organisms to cope with different environments. Constraint-based stoichiometric modeling of metabolic networks has become an indispensable tool for such studies. Herein, we review the basic theoretical underpinnings of constraint-based stoichiometric modeling of metabolic networks. Basic concepts, such as stoichiometry, chemical moiety conservation, flux modes, flux balance analysis, and flux solution spaces, are explained with simple, illustrative examples. We emphasize the mathematical definitions and their network topological interpretations.},

  abstract = "Recent pan-cancer studies have delineated patterns of structural
              genomic variation across thousands of tumor whole genome
              sequences. It is not known to what extent the shortcomings of
              short read ($\leq$ 150 bp) whole genome sequencing (WGS) used for
              structural variant analysis has limited our understanding of
              cancer genome structure. To formally address this, we introduce
              the concept of ``loose ends'' - copy number alterations that
              cannot be mapped to a rearrangement by WGS but can be indirectly
              detected through the analysis of junction-balanced genome graphs.
              Analyzing 2,319 pan-cancer WGS cases across 31 tumor types, we
              found loose ends were enriched in reference repeats and fusions
              of the mappable genome to repetitive or foreign sequences. Among
              these we found genomic footprints of neotelomeres, which were
              surprisingly enriched in cancers with low telomerase expression
              and alternate lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Our results
              also provide a rigorous upper bound on the role of non-allelic
              homologous recombination (NAHR) in large-scale cancer structural
              variation, while nominating INO80 , FANCA , and ARID1A as

              that short read WGS maps >97\% of all large-scale (>10 kbp)

              applications of short read WGS and delineate precise directions

               has been identified in only a few cases. Most of these
               rearrangements were stably transmitted, in an unbalanced form,
               from a healthy mother to her child with congenital abnormalities
               probably caused by de novo copy-number changes of dosage
               sensitive genes. We describe a G-CTH transmitted through three
               generations in 11 healthy carriers. METHODS: Conventional
               cytogenetic analysis, mate-pair sequencing, and polymerase chain
               reaction (PCR) were used to identify the chromosome
               rearrangement and characterize the breakpoints in all three
               generations. RESULTS: We identified an apparently balanced
               translocation t(3;5), later shown to be a G-CTH, in all
               individuals of a three-generation family. The G-CTH stably
               segregated without occurrence of additional rearrangements;
               however, several spontaneous abortions were reported, possibly
               due to unbalanced transmission. Although seven protein-coding
               genes are interrupted, no clinical features can be definitively
               attributed to the affected genes. However, it can be speculated
               that truncation of one of these genes, encoding
               ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR), a
               key component of the DNA damage response, may be related to
               G-CTH formation. CONCLUSION: G-CTH rearrangements are not always
               associated with abnormal phenotypes and may be misinterpreted as
               balanced two-way translocations, suggesting that G-CTH is an
               underdiagnosed phenomenon.Genet Med 18 5, 494-500.},

              identified in previous studies. We examine the spectrum of
              structural variants (SVs) instigated by natural telomere crisis.
              Eight spontaneous post-crisis clones did not show prominent
              patterns of BFB cycles or chromothripsis. Their crisis-induced
              genome rearrangements varied from infrequent simple SVs to more
              frequent and complex SVs. In contrast, BFB cycles and
              chromothripsis occurred in MRC5 fibroblast clones that escaped
              telomere crisis after CRISPR-controlled telomerase activation.
              This system revealed convergent evolutionary lineages altering
              one allele of chromosome 12p, where a short telomere likely
              predisposed to fusion. Remarkably, the 12p chromothripsis and BFB
              events were stabilized by independent fusions to chromosome 21.
              The data establish that telomere crisis can generate a wide

               chromothripsis) structural variant classes. Applying a novel

               junction copy number (JCN) across 2,778 tumor whole-genome
               sequences, we uncovered three novel complex rearrangement
               phenomena: pyrgo, rigma, and tyfonas. Pyrgo are ``towers'' of
               low-JCN duplications associated with early-replicating regions,
               superenhancers, and breast or ovarian cancers. Rigma comprise
               ``chasms'' of low-JCN deletions enriched in late-replicating
               fragile sites and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Tyfonas are
               ``typhoons'' of high-JCN junctions and fold-back inversions
               associated with expressed protein-coding fusions, breakend
               hypermutation, and acral, but not cutaneous, melanomas.

              cancer genomes1. Various forms of RNA alterations have been
              described in cancer, including overexpression2, altered splicing3
              and gene fusions4; however, it is difficult to attribute these to
              underlying genomic changes owing to heterogeneity among patients
              and tumour types, and the relatively small cohorts of patients
              for whom samples have been analysed by both transcriptome and
              whole-genome sequencing. Here we present, to our knowledge, the
              most comprehensive catalogue of cancer-associated gene
              alterations to date, obtained by characterizing tumour
              transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of
              Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer
              Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)5.
              Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we associated several
              categories of RNA alterations with germline and somatic DNA
              alterations, and identified probable genetic mechanisms. Somatic
              copy-number alterations were the major drivers of variations in
              total gene and allele-specific expression. We identified 649
              associations of somatic single-nucleotide variants with gene
              expression in cis, of which 68.4\% involved associations with
              flanking non-coding regions of the gene. We found 1,900 splicing
              alterations associated with somatic mutations, including the
              formation of exons within introns in proximity to Alu elements.
              In addition, 82\% of gene fusions were associated with structural
              variants, including 75 of a new class, termed 'bridged' fusions,
              in which a third genomic location bridges two genes. We observed
              transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer
              types and have associations with variations in DNA mutational
              signatures. This compendium of RNA alterations in the genomic
              context provides a rich resource for identifying genes and

              across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural
              variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution,
              assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in
              late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem
              duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are
              enriched in early-replicating regions-as are unbalanced
              translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement
              generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number
              gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent
              structure consists of 2-7 templates copied from distinct regions
              of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of
              templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in
              liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide

The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the overall composition of the genome itself. RESULTS: We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. It leverages the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and enabled us to identify the 5-14% of the human, mouse, fly and yeast genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the “dark matter” of the genome, including of known clinically relevant variations in these regions.

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.}, number={10}, journal={Nucleic acids research}, author={Benjamini, Yuval and Speed, Terence P.}, year={2012}, month={May}, pages={e72} }

               For structural variants, we present two methods of driver

  abstract = {Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, occurs preferentially
              at specific genomic regions known as common fragile sites (CFSs).
              CFSs are evolutionarily conserved and late replicating regions
              with AT-rich sequences, and CFS instability is correlated with
              cancer. In the last decade, much progress has been made toward
              understanding the mechanisms of chromosomal instability at CFSs.
              However, despite tremendous efforts, identifying a
              cancer-associated CFS gene (CACG) remains a challenge and little
              is known about the function of CACGs at most CFS loci. Recent

              presents a comprehensive analysis using conventional and

              levels in chromosome bands are conserved between the two mouse
              strains and between syntenic mouse and human DNA segments.
              Furthermore, four additional mouse CFSs were found to be

              although genomic regions with low CNV frequencies were enriched

We used this relationship to analyze variation in replication timing among 161 individuals sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. Genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing. We call these "replication timing quantitative trait loci" (rtQTLs). rtQTLs involved the differential use of replication origins, exhibited allele-specific effects on replication timing, and associated with gene expression variation at megabase scales.

BRCA1-mutant cancers show minimal resection of double-strand breaks, which renders them deficient in homology-directed repair and sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)3–8. When BRCA1 is absent, the resection of double-strand breaks is thought to be prevented by 53BP1, RIF1 and the REV7–SHLD1–SHLD2–SHLD3 (shieldin) complex, and loss of these factors diminishes sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors4,6–9. Here we address the mechanism by which 53BP1–RIF1–shieldin regulates the generation of recombinogenic 3′ overhangs. We report that CTC1–STN1–TEN1 (CST)10, a complex similar to replication protein A that functions as an accessory factor of polymerase-α (Polα)–primase11, is a downstream effector in the 53BP1 pathway. CST interacts with shieldin and localizes with Polα to sites of DNA damage in a 53BP1- and shieldin-dependent manner. As with loss of 53BP1, RIF1 or shieldin, the depletion of CST leads to increased resection. In BRCA1-deficient cells, CST blocks RAD51 loading and promotes the efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors. In addition, Polα inhibition diminishes the effect of PARP1 inhibitors. These data suggest that CST–Polα-mediated fill-in helps to control the repair of double-strand breaks by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin. 53BP1 and shieldin recruit the CTC1–STN1–TEN1 complex and polymerase-α to sites of DNA damage to help control the repair of double-strand breaks.}},

The data reveal two DNA damage response pathways not previously observed upon deletion of individual shelterin proteins. The shelterin-free telomeres are processed by microhomology-mediated alternative-NHEJ when Ku70/80 is absent and are attacked by nucleolytic degradation in the absence of 53BP1.

The evolution of this marker chromosome was associated with the terminal deletion of the normal long arm of the HSR-bearing chromosome 3 and may have involved ring formation as a result of fusion between the HSR on the short arm and the broken end of the long arm. Evidence was obtained for breakage at different sites within the ring, producing chromosomes with HSRs located terminally on either the long arms or both arms. The terminally located HSR underwent elongation in some cells presumably as a result of a breakage-fusionbridge cycle characteristic of instability due to telomeric loss.

              genetic heterogeneity and accelerated tumor evolution1-3;
              however, its frequency and clinical impact are unclear. Using
              computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 3,212
              cancer patients, we show that ecDNA amplification frequently
              occurs in most cancer types but not in blood or normal tissue.
              Oncogenes were highly enriched on amplified ecDNA, and the most
              common recurrent oncogene amplifications arose on ecDNA. EcDNA
              amplifications resulted in higher levels of oncogene
              transcription compared to copy number-matched linear DNA, coupled
              with enhanced chromatin accessibility, and more frequently
              resulted in transcript fusions. Patients whose cancers carried
              ecDNA had significantly shorter survival, even when controlled
              for tissue type, than patients whose cancers were not driven by
              ecDNA-based oncogene amplification. The results presented here
              demonstrate that ecDNA-based oncogene amplification is common in
              cancer, is different from chromosomal amplification and drives
              poor outcome for patients across many cancer types.",

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fragile sites are the chromosomal regions that are
              susceptible to breakage, and their frequency varies among the
              human population. Based on the frequency of fragile site
              induction, they are categorized as common and rare fragile sites.
              Common fragile sites are sensitive to replication stress and
              often rearranged in cancer. Rare fragile sites are the archetypal
              trinucleotide repeats. Fragile sites are known to be involved in
              chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. Human miRNA genes are also
              present at fragile sites. A better understanding of genes and
              miRNAs lying in the fragile site regions and their association
              with disease progression is required. RESULT: HumCFS is a
              manually curated database of human chromosomal fragile sites.
              HumCFS provides useful information on fragile sites such as
              coordinates on the chromosome, cytoband, their chemical inducers
              and frequency of fragile site (rare or common), genes and miRNAs
              lying in fragile sites. Protein coding genes in the fragile sites
              were identified by mapping the coordinates of fragile sites with
              human genome Ensembl (GRCh38/hg38). Genes present in fragile
              sites were further mapped to DisGenNET database, to understand
              their possible link with human diseases. Human miRNAs from
              miRBase was also mapped on fragile site coordinates. In brief,
              HumCFS provides useful information about 125 human chromosomal
              fragile sites and their association with 4921 human
              protein-coding genes and 917 human miRNA's. CONCLUSION:
              User-friendly web-interface of HumCFS and hyper-linking with
              other resources will help researchers to search for genes, miRNAs
              efficiently and to intersect the relationship among them. For
              easy data retrieval and analysis, we have integrated standard
              web-based tools, such as JBrowse, BLAST etc. Also, the user can

              intensity of positive selection that drives mutations to high
              frequency in tumors, yielding higher prevalences than expected on
              the basis of mutation and neutral drift alone. We apply this
              approach to a sample of 525 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
              exomes, producing a rank-ordered list of gene variants by
              selection intensity. Our results illustrate the complementarity
              of calculating the intensity of selection on mutations along with
              tallying the prevalence of individual substitutions in cancer:
              while many of the most prevalently-altered genes were heavily
              selected, their relative importance to the cancer phenotype
              differs from their prevalence and from their P value, with some
              infrequent variants exhibiting evidence of strong positive
              selection. Furthermore, we extend our analysis of effect size by
              quantifying the degree to which mutational processes (such as
              APOBEC mutagenesis) contributes mutations that are highly
              selected, driving head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We

              bases at two sites whose mutant states are subject to high net

              of 12 cell lines showed a 20- to 35-fold amplification of the
              c-myc oncogene, 3 cell lines showed an 80- to 130-fold
              amplification of N-myc oncogene, and one cell line had a
              simultaneous amplification of the c-myb and N-myc oncogene. In
              this cell line both oncogenes were transcriptionally highly
              active at the same time. A variant subpopulation of SCLC
              expressed an 8.5-kilobase v-fms homologous transcript at high
              levels but without amplification of the c-fms gene. All cell

  abstract = {The genomic alterations associated with cancers are numerous and
              varied, involving both isolated and large-scale complex genomic
              rearrangements (CGRs). Although the underlying mechanisms are not
              well understood, CGRs have been implicated in tumorigenesis.
              Here, we introduce CouGaR, a novel method for characterizing the
              genomic structure of amplified CGRs, leveraging both depth of
              coverage (DOC) and discordant pair-end mapping techniques. We
              applied our method to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas and identify amplified CGRs in at least
              5.2\% (10+ copies) to 17.8\% (6+ copies) of the samples.
              Furthermore, ∼95\% of these amplified CGRs contain genes
              previously implicated in tumorigenesis, indicating the importance
              and widespread occurrence of CGRs in cancers. Additionally,
              CouGaR identified the occurrence of 'chromoplexy' in nearly 63\%
              of all prostate cancer samples and 30\% of all bladder cancer
              samples. To further validate the accuracy of our method, we
              experimentally tested 17 predicted fusions in two pediatric
              glioma samples and validated 15 of these (88\%) with precise
              resolution of the breakpoints via qPCR experiments and Sanger
              sequencing, with nearly perfect copy count concordance.
              Additionally, to further help display and understand the
              structure of CGRs, we have implemented CouGaR-viz, a generic

              enable high throughput single cell DNA-Seq across thousands of

              automated partitioning technology for whole genome sequencing. We
              applied this approach on a set of gastric cancer cell lines and a
              primary gastric tumor. In parallel, we conducted a separate
              single cell RNA-Seq analysis on these same cancers and used copy
              number to compare results. This joint study, covering thousands
              of single cell genomes and transcriptomes, revealed extensive
              cellular diversity based on distinct copy number changes,
              numerous subclonal populations and in the case of the primary
              tumor, subclonal gene expression signatures. We found genomic
              evidence of positive selection -- where the percentage of
              replicating cells per clone is higher than expected -- indicating
              ongoing tumor evolution. Our study demonstrates that joining

              of genetic variability in somatic cells and can dysregulate
              cancer-related pathways. However, discovering somatic SVs in

              framework that integrates read depth, template strand and
              haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual

              transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic

              Strand-coordinated clusters of mutated cytosines or guanines

              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect
              patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations,
              structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection
              of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding
              mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4;

              characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes,

              increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy
              number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to
              simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses
              suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

The expansion of genetically distinct sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance, and if so, would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively quantifying tumour heterogeneity have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and cascading genomic rearrangements. To address these challenges, we present MEDICC, a method for phylogenetic reconstruction and heterogeneity quantification based on a Minimum Event Distance for Intra-tumour Copy-number Comparisons. Using a transducer-based pairwise comparison function, we determine optimal phasing of major and minor alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in reconstruction accuracy, and additionally allows unbiased numerical quantification of tumour heterogeneity. Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential to understand the functional consequences of tumour heterogeneity. The MEDICC algorithms are independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both next-generation sequencing and array CGH data.},

Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11\% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery. Two Articles in this issue add major data sets to the growing picture of the cancer genome. Bignell et al. analysed a large number of homozygous gene deletions in a collection of 746 publicly available cancer cell lines. Combined with information about hemizygous deletions of the same genes, the data suggest that many deletions found in cancer reflect the position of a gene at a fragile site in the genome, rather than as a recessive cancer gene whose loss confers a selective growth advantage. Beroukhim et al. present the largest data set to date on somatic copy-number variations across more than 3,000 specimens of human primary cancers. Many alterations are shared between multiple tumour types. Functional experiments demonstrate an oncogenic role for the apoptosis genes MCL1 and BCL2L1 that are associated with amplifications found in many cancers. Homozygous gene deletions in cancer cells occur over recessive cancer genes (where they can confer selective growth advantage) or over genes at fragile sites of the genome (where they are thought to reflect increased DNA breakage). Here, a large number of homozygous deletions in a collection of cancer cell lines are identified and analysed to derive structural signatures for the two different types of deletion. More deletions are found in inherently fragile regions, and fewer overlying recessive genes.},

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full
              use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability
              of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for
              the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that
              incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the
              raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and
              an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
              mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and
              real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and

              As national biobanks, disease-association studies, and clinical
              genetic testing have grown increasingly reliant on genome
              sequencing, population references such as the Genome Aggregation
              Database (gnomAD)4 have become integral in the interpretation of
              single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)5. However, there are no
              reference maps of SVs from high-coverage genome sequencing
              comparable to those for SNVs. Here we present a reference of
              sequence-resolved SVs constructed from 14,891 genomes across
              diverse global populations (54\% non-European) in gnomAD. We
              discovered a rich and complex landscape of 433,371 SVs, from
              which we estimate that SVs are responsible for 25-29\% of all
              rare protein-truncating events per genome. We found strong
              correlations between natural selection against damaging SNVs and
              rare SVs that disrupt or duplicate protein-coding sequence, which
              suggests that genes that are highly intolerant to
              loss-of-function are also sensitive to increased dosage6. We also
              uncovered modest selection against noncoding SVs in
              cis-regulatory elements, although selection against
              protein-truncating SVs was stronger than all noncoding effects.
              Finally, we identified very large (over one megabase), rare SVs
              in 3.9\% of samples, and estimate that 0.13\% of individuals may
              carry an SV that meets the existing criteria for clinically
              important incidental findings7. This SV resource is freely

Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2\%–3\% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25\% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.},

We have used this technique to examine 243 breast tumors from two separate studies for which detailed clinical data were available. The very high resolution of this technology has enabled us to identify three characteristic patterns of genomic copy number variation in diploid tumors and to measure correlations with patient survival. One of these patterns is characterized by multiple closely spaced amplicons, or “firestorms,” limited to single chromosome arms. These multiple amplifications are highly correlated with aggressive disease and poor survival even when the rest of the genome is relatively quiet. Analysis of a selected subset of clinical material suggests that a simple genomic calculation, based on the number and proximity of genomic alterations, correlates with life-table estimates of the probability of overall survival in patients with primary breast cancer. Based on this sample, we generate the working hypothesis that copy number profiling might provide information useful in making clinical decisions, especially regarding the use or not of systemic therapies (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy), in the management of operable primary breast cancer with ostensibly good prognosis, for example, small, node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive diploid cases.}},

We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term “chromoplexy,” frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis.},

Because intercellular heterogeneity is often found in neoplastic tissues, we investigated the occurrence of BFB events in human solid tumors. Evidence of frequent BFB events was found in malignancies that showed unspecific chromosome aberrations, including ring chromosomes, dicentric chromosomes, and telomeric associations, as well as extensive intratumor heterogeneity in the pattern of structural changes but not in tumors with tumor-specific aberrations and low variability. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that chromosomes participating in anaphase bridge formation were involved in a significantly higher number of structural aberrations than other chromosomes. Tumors with BFB events showed a decreased elimination rate of unstable chromosome aberrations after irradiation compared with normal cells and other tumor cells. This result suggests that a combination of mitotically unstable chromosomes and an elevated tolerance to chromosomal damage leads to constant genomic reorganization in many malignancies, thereby providing a flexible genetic system for clonal evolution and progression.},

B/F/B cycles have been associated with low-copy gene amplification in human cancer cells, and have been proposed to be an initiating event in high-copy gene amplification. We have found that spontaneous telomere loss on a marker chromosome 16 in a human tumor cell line results in sister chromatid fusion and prolonged periods of chromosome instability. The high rate of anaphase bridges involving chromosome 16 demonstrates that this instability results from B/F/B cycles. The amplification of subtelomeric DNA on the marker chromosome provides conclusive evidence that B/F/B cycles initiated by spontaneous telomere loss are a mechanism for gene amplification in human cancer cells.},

Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer.

By combining extensive CFS molecular mapping and a comprehensive analysis of CFS features, we show that the pool of CFSs for all human cell types consists of chromosome regions with genes over 300 kb long, and different subsets of these loci are committed to fragility in different cell types. Interestingly, we find that transcription of large genes does not dictate CFS fragility. We further demonstrate that, like CFSs, cancer deletions are significantly enriched in genes over 300 kb long.

These hotspots may be sites of selective susceptibility to double-strand-break damage due to high transcriptional activity or, through incrementally increasing copy number, may be sites of secondary selective pressure. The transcriptomic consequences ranged from strong individual oncogene effects to weak but quantifiable multigene expression effects. We thus present a somatic-rearrangement mutational process affecting coding sequences and noncoding regulatory elements and contributing a continuum of driver consequences, from modest to strong effects, thereby supporting a polygenic model of cancer development.},

Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape1,2,3,4,5. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific6,7. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.},

  abstract = {In this study, we show that evolutionarily conserved chromosome loop anchors bound by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin are vulnerable to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B). Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements. Video Abstract},

Whole-genome sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinomas revealed noncoding somatic mutational hotspots near VMP1/MIR21 and indel hotspots in surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPB, and SFTPC). Extrapolation to other solid cancers demonstrated highly recurrent and tumor-type-specific indel hotspots targeting the noncoding regions of highly expressed genes defining certain secretory cellular lineages: albumin (ALB) in liver carcinoma, gastric lipase (LIPF) in stomach carcinoma, and thyroglobulin (TG) in thyroid carcinoma. The sequence contexts of indels targeting lineage-defining genes were significantly enriched in the AATAATD DNA motif and specific chromatin contexts, including H3K27ac and H3K36me3.

Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation.

  abstract = {Telomere crisis occurs during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve leads to frequent telomere fusions. The resulting dicentric chromosomes have been proposed to drive genome instability. Here, we examine the fate of dicentric human chromosomes in telomere crisis. We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into 50–200 μm chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3–20 hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3′ nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis.},

A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. The connection between DNA replication timing and changes that occur to the epigenome in cancer are still poorly understood.

However, our understanding of the earliest phases of colorectal neoplastic changes—which may occur in morphologically normal tissue—is comparatively limited, as for most cancer types. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to analyse hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed; some of these were ubiquitous and continuous, whereas others were only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during certain periods of life. Probable driver mutations were present in around 1\% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium. Colorectal cancers exhibit substantially increased mutational burdens relative to normal cells. Sequencing normal colorectal cells provides quantitative insights into the genomic and clonal evolution of cancer. Genome sequencing of hundreds of normal colonic crypts from 42 individuals sheds light on mutational processes and driver mutations in normal colorectal epithelial cells.},

  abstract = {The most common causes of chronic liver disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes1–7. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures8, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100–500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher mutational burden than normal liver. Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1–5\% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic liver disease; and others—arising from exogenous exposures—were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic liver, but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of liver tissue as it progresses from health to disease. Whole-genome sequencing of liver microdissections from five healthy individuals and nine with cirrhosis demonstrates the effects of liver disease on the genome, including increased rates of mutation, complex structural variation and different mutational signatures.},

Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed “kataegis,” was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. PaperClip},

Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour–normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity.

              integrating ultrastructural imaging, long-range optical mapping

              demonstrate the structure of circular ecDNA. Pan-cancer analyses

              expressed genes in the transcriptome of the tumours, linking
              increased copy number with high transcription levels.
              Quantitative assessment of the chromatin state reveals that
              although ecDNA is packaged into chromatin with intact domain
              structure, it lacks higher-order compaction that is typical of
              chromosomes and displays significantly enhanced chromatin

              significantly greater number of ultra-long-range interactions

               analyze the MYCN amplicon structure using short-read and
               Nanopore sequencing and its chromatin landscape using ChIP-seq,

               overexpression. The first class always co-amplifies a proximal
               enhancer driven by the noradrenergic core regulatory circuit
               (CRC). The second class of MYCN amplicons is characterized by
               high structural complexity, lacks key local enhancers, and

               CRC-driven enhancers. Thus, ectopic enhancer hijacking can

  abstract = {Approximately 1–5\% of breast cancers are attributed to inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and are selectively sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In other cancer types, germline and/or somatic mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) also confer selective sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Thus, assays to detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors have been sought. Recently, somatic substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement patterns, or 'mutational signatures', were associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction. Herein we used a lasso logistic regression model to identify six distinguishing mutational signatures predictive of BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. A weighted model called HRDetect was developed to accurately detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient samples. HRDetect identifies BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors with 98.7\% sensitivity (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). Application of this model in a cohort of 560 individuals with breast cancer, of whom 22 were known to carry a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, allowed us to identify an additional 22 tumors with somatic loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 47 tumors with functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency where no mutation was detected. We validated HRDetect on independent cohorts of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and demonstrated its efficacy in alternative sequencing strategies. Integrating all of the classes of mutational signatures thus reveals a larger proportion of individuals with breast cancer harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency (up to 22\%) than hitherto appreciated (∼1–5\%) who could have selective therapeutic sensitivity to PARP inhibition.},

We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.},

We show that, in primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus–Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with \textbackslashtextasciitilde10 kilobase tandem duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.},

We devised a robust genomic metric able to identify cancers with a chromotype called tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) characterized by frequent and distributed tandem duplications (TDs). Enriched only in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in ovarian, endometrial, and liver cancers, TDP tumors conjointly exhibit tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, disruption of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), and increased expression of DNA replication genes pointing at rereplication in a defective checkpoint environment as a plausible causal mechanism. The resultant TDs in TDP augment global oncogene expression and disrupt tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, the TDP strongly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in both TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts. We conclude that the TDP is a common cancer chromotype that coordinately alters oncogene/tumor suppressor expression with potential as a marker for chemotherapeutic response.},

The RecBCD helicase–nuclease complex is the main end-processing machine in Gram-negative bacteria. Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 can play a direct role in end resection in archaea and eukaryota, respectively, by removing end-blocking lesions and act indirectly by recruiting the helicases and nucleases responsible for extensive resection.

Compared with short-fragment sequencing, GROC-SVs substantially improves the specificity of breakpoint detection at comparable sensitivity. This approach also performs sequence assembly across multiple breakpoints simultaneously, enabling the reconstruction of events exhibiting remarkable complexity.

As such, karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively to discover novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at single-base-pair resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently, whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of monoallelic expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from paired tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes of these tumors using RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific expression. We show that the majority of monoallelic expression in the transcriptomes of triple-negative breast cancer can be explained by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper bound for monoallelic expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific modifications such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumors.}},

Complex genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis and chromoplexy, generated 74\% of known fusion oncogenes, including EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS1, and KIF5B-RET. Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups—EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations. Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes.},

  abstract = {Melanoma of the skin is a common cancer only in Europeans, whereas it arises in internal body surfaces (mucosal sites) and on the hands and feet (acral sites) in people throughout the world. Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences. Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma. Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however, neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes, some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.},

We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that of other non-Africans.},

We describe SvABA, an efficient and accurate method for detecting SVs from short-read sequencing data using genome-wide local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We evaluated SvABA's performance on the NA12878 human genome and in simulated and real cancer genomes. SvABA demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity across a large spectrum of SVs and substantially improves detection performance for variants in the 20-300 bp range, compared with existing methods. SvABA also identifies complex somatic rearrangements with chains of short (<1000 bp) templated-sequence insertions copied from distant genomic regions. We applied SvABA to 344 cancer genomes from 11 cancer types and found that short templated-sequence insertions occur in ∼4\% of all somatic rearrangements. Finally, we demonstrate that SvABA can identify sites of viral integration and cancer driver alterations containing medium-sized (50-300 bp) SVs.},

The core of the neochromosome is amplified, rearranged, and corroded through hundreds of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Under selective pressure, amplified oncogenes are overexpressed, while coamplified passenger genes may be silenced epigenetically. New material may be captured during punctuated chromothriptic events. Centromeric corrosion leads to crisis, which is resolved through neocentromere formation or native centromere capture. Finally, amplification terminates, and the neochromosome core is stabilized in linear form by telomere capture.

Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway.

A natural extension of this hypothesis is that the clonal expansion must be driven by alteration of genes at recombination breakpoints whose altered functions actually drive clonal expansion. Nevertheless, when the FHIT gene was discovered at FRA3B, the most active common chromosome fragile region, and proposed as an example of a tumor suppressor gene altered by chromosome translocations and deletions, a wave of reports suggested that the FHIT gene was altered in cancer simply because it was in a fragile region and not because it had contributed to the clonal expansion, thus turning the original hypothesis upside down. Now, after nearly ten years and more than 500 FHIT reports, it is apparent that FHIT is an important tumor suppressor gene and that there are genes at other fragile regions that contribute significantly to development of cancer. A second fragile gene with a demonstrated role in cancer development is the WWOX gene on chromosome 16q; alterations to the WWOX gene contribute to development of hormone responsive and other cancers. Results of our recent studies of these two fragile tumor suppressor genes were summarized at the first Fragilome meeting in Heidelberg, Feb. 2005.},

Many CFSs are enriched with AT-dinucleotide rich sequences (AT-DRSs) which have the potential to form stable secondary structures upon unwinding the double helix during DNA replication. These stable structures can potentially perturb DNA replication progression, leading to genomic instability. Using site-specific targeting system, we show that targeted integration of a 3.4 kb AT-DRS derived from the human CFS FRA16C into a chromosomally stable region within the human genome is able to drive fragile site formation under conditions of replication stress. Analysis of >1300 X chromosomes integrated with the 3.4 kb AT-DRS revealed recurrent gaps and breaks at the integration site. DNA sequences derived from the integrated AT-DRS showed in vitro a significantly increased tendency to fold into branched secondary structures, supporting the predicted mechanism of instability. Our findings clearly indicate that intrinsic DNA features, such as complexed repeated sequence motifs, predispose the human genome to chromosomal instability.},

According to information available from human genome browsers aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication induces 77 of 88 known common FS. However, in the literature additional FS are reported, which are also, at least in part, inducible by aphidicolin. To the best of our knowledge, here we present the first and largest ever done systematic, whole genome-directed and comprehensive screening for aphidicolin-inducible breakage-prone regions. The study was performed on stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of 3 unrelated healthy individuals. Twenty-five thousand metaphase spreads were analyzed and overall 22,537 FS located in 230 different loci were recorded. Sixty-one of those FS were never observed before and 52 were already previously reported but not included in genome browsers and yet verified. Interestingly, aphidicolin was able to induce all types of rare and common FS, suggesting that these breakage-prone regions are less dependent on the inducing chemicals than originally supposed. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive genome wide map for FS and studied possible correlations of chromosome length and GTG-banding level with FS-frequency. To handle FS better in future, an extension of the already existing alphabetical nomenclature for FS on single chromosomes is suggested.},

  abstract = {Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFSs) are unstable genomic regions that break under replication stress and are involved in structural variation. They frequently are sites of chromosomal rearrangements in cancer and of viral integration. However, CFSs are undercharacterized at the molecular level and thus difficult to predict computationally. Newly available genome-wide profiling studies provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to associate CFSs with features of their local genomic contexts. Here, we contrasted the genomic landscape of cytogenetically defined aphidicolin-induced CFSs (aCFSs) to that of nonfragile sites, using multiple logistic regression. We also analyzed aCFS breakage frequencies as a function of their genomic landscape, using standard multiple regression. We show that local genomic features are effective predictors both of regions harboring aCFSs (explaining ∼81\% of the deviance in logistic regression models) and of aCFS breakage frequencies (explaining ∼45\% of the variance in standard regression models). In our optimal models (based on a combination of biological interpretability and high R-squared value), aCFSs are predominantly located in G-negative chromosomal bands and away from centromeres, are enriched in Alu repeats, and have high DNA flexibility. In alternative models, CpG island density, H3K4me1 coverage, and mononucleotide microsatellite coverage are significant predictors. Also, aCFSs have high fragility when colocated with evolutionarily conserved chromosomal breakpoints. Our models are predictive of the fragility of aCFSs mapped at a higher resolution. Importantly, the genomic features we identified here as significant predictors of fragility allow us to draw valuable inferences on the molecular mechanisms underlying aCFSs.},

  abstract = {The development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened the door to novel methods for detecting copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome. While in the past CNVs have been detected based on array CGH data, recent studies have shown that depth-of-coverage information from HTS technologies can also be used for the reliable identification of large copy-variable regions. Such methods, however, are hindered by sequencing biases that lead certain regions of the genome to be over- or undersampled, lowering their resolution and ability to accurately identify the exact breakpoints of the variants. In this work, we develop a method for CNV detection that supplements the depth-of-coverage with paired-end mapping information, where mate pairs mapping discordantly to the reference serve to indicate the presence of variation. Our algorithm, called CNVer, combines this information within a unified computational framework called the donor graph, allowing us to better mitigate the sequencing biases that cause uneven local coverage and accurately predict CNVs. We use CNVer to detect 4879 CNVs in the recently described genome of a Yoruban individual. Most of the calls (77\%) coincide with previously known variants within the Database of Genomic Variants, while 81\% of deletion copy number variants previously known for this individual coincide with one of our loss calls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CNVer can reconstruct the absolute copy counts of segments of the donor genome and evaluate the feasibility of using CNVer with low coverage datasets.},

  title    = {{An algorithmic approach for breakage-fusion-bridge detection in tumor genomes}},
  doi      = {10.1073/pnas.1220977110},
  abstract = {Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) is a mechanism of genomic instability characterized by the joining and subsequent tearing apart of sister chromatids. When this process is repeated during multiple rounds of cell division, it leads to patterns of copy number increases of chromosomal segments as well as fold-back inversions where duplicated segments are arranged head-to-head. These structural variations can then drive tumorigenesis. BFB can be observed in progress using cytogenetic techniques, but generally BFB must be inferred from data such as microarrays or sequencing collected after BFB has ceased. Making correct inferences from this data is not straightforward, particularly given the complexity of some cancer genomes and BFB’s ability to generate a wide range of rearrangement patterns. Here we present algorithms to aid the interpretation of evidence for BFB. We first pose the BFB count-vector problem: given a chromosome segmentation and segment copy numbers, decide whether BFB can yield a chromosome with the given segment counts. We present a linear time algorithm for the problem, in contrast to a previous exponential time algorithm. We then combine this algorithm with fold-back inversions to develop tests for BFB. We show that, contingent on assumptions about cancer genome evolution, count vectors and fold-back inversions are sufficient evidence for detecting BFB. We apply the presented techniques to paired-end sequencing data from pancreatic tumors and confirm a previous finding of BFB as well as identify a chromosomal region likely rearranged by BFB cycles, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.},

The direct consequence of ecDNA gains in these cases is an increase in DNA copy number of the oncogenes residing on the extrachromosomal element. A secondary effect, perhaps even more important, is that the unequal segregation of ecDNA from a parental tumour cell to offspring cells rapidly increases tumour heterogeneity, thus providing the tumour with an additional array of responses to microenvironment-induced and therapy-induced stress factors and perhaps providing an evolutionary advantage. This Perspectives article discusses the current knowledge and potential implications of oncogene amplification on ecDNA in cancer. The existence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer was first described decades ago, but recent reports of oncogene amplification on ecDNA have reinvigorated interest in this field.

In addition to coding mutations, COSMIC covers all the genetic mechanisms by which somatic mutations promote cancer, including non-coding mutations, gene fusions, copy-number variants and drug-resistance mutations. COSMIC is primarily hand-curated, ensuring quality, accuracy and descriptive data capture. Building on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new initiatives that allow us to prioritize key genes and diseases, and to react more quickly and comprehensively to new findings in the literature. Alongside improvements to the public website and data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein structures, their protein structural and functional impacts, and implications for druggability. In parallel with COSMIC’s deep and broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) describes a curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer. Currently describing 719 genes, the CGC has recently introduced functional descriptions of how each gene drives disease, summarized into the 10 cancer Hallmarks.},

               segments. Recent results implicate extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)
               as the primary driver of focal copy number amplification (fCNA)
               - enabling gene amplification, rapid tumor evolution, and the
               rewiring of regulatory circuitry. Resolving an fCNA's structure
               is a first step in deciphering the mechanisms of its genesis and
               the fCNA's subsequent biological consequences. We introduce a
               computational method, AmpliconReconstructor (AR), for
               integrating optical mapping (OM) of long DNA fragments (>150 kb)
               with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to resolve fCNAs at
               single-nucleotide resolution. AR uses an NGS-derived breakpoint
               graph alongside OM scaffolds to produce high-fidelity
               reconstructions. After validating its performance through
               multiple simulation strategies, AR reconstructed fCNAs in seven
               cancer cell lines to reveal the complex architecture of ecDNA, a

ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination, but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known. Recently, mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers, pediatric glioblastomas, and other tumors of the central nervous system, suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers. We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic, molecular biological, and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines, including cell lines derived in vitro. Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT–immortalized cell lines. In addition, ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements, marked micronucleation, defects in the G2/M checkpoint, and altered double-strand break (DSB) repair. These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers.},

Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act. Whole-genome sequencing data from more than 2,500 cancers of 38 tumour types reveal 16 signatures that can be used to classify somatic structural variants, highlighting the diversity of genomic rearrangements in cancer.}},

Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ variants in protein-coding genes. Exome sequencing data from 60,706 people of diverse geographic ancestry is presented, providing insight into genetic variation across populations, and illuminating the relationship between DNA variants and human disease. As part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) project, Daniel MacArthur and colleagues report on the generation and analysis of high-quality exome sequencing data from 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestry. This provides the most comprehensive catalogue of human protein-coding genetic variation to date, yielding unprecedented resolution for the analysis of very rare variants across multiple human populations. The catalogue is freely accessible and provides a critical reference panel for the clinical interpretation of genetic variants and the discovery of disease-related genes.},

                 changes over time, little is understood about the
                 temporal-spatial dynamics of genomes in premalignant tissues
                 that progress to cancer compared to those that remain
                 cancer-free. Here we use whole genome sequencing to contrast
                 genomic alterations in 427 longitudinal samples from 40
                 patients with stable Barrett's esophagus compared to 40
                 Barrett's patients who progressed to esophageal adenocarcinoma
                 (ESAD). We show the same somatic mutational processes were
                 active in Barrett's tissue regardless of outcome, with high
                 levels of mutation, ESAD gene and focal chromosomal
                 alterations, and similar mutational signatures. The critical
                 distinction between stable Barrett's versus those who progress
                 to cancer is acquisition and expansion of TP53-/- cell
                 populations having complex structural variants and high-level
                 amplifications, which were detectable up to six years prior to

This Analysis uses the published literature to form a DNA damage response network and then uses this to identify potential synthetic lethal interactions and to assess the druggability of proteins in the DNA damage response network. The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential for maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell, and its disruption is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Classically, defects in the DDR have been exploited therapeutically in the treatment of cancer with radiation therapies or genotoxic chemotherapies. More recently, protein components of the DDR systems have been identified as promising avenues for targeted cancer therapeutics. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the function, role in cancer and therapeutic potential of 450 expert-curated human DDR genes. We discuss the DDR drugs that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or that are under clinical investigation. We examine large-scale genomic and expression data for 15 cancers to identify deregulated components of the DDR, and we apply systematic computational analysis to identify DDR proteins that are amenable to modulation by small molecules, highlighting potential novel therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a poor-prognosis cancer type with rapidly rising incidence. Understanding of the genetic events driving EAC development is limited, and there are few molecular biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutics. Using a cohort of 551 genomically characterized EACs with matched RNA sequencing data, we discovered 77 EAC driver genes and 21 noncoding driver elements. We identified a mean of 4.4 driver events per tumor, which were derived more commonly from mutations than copy number alterations, and compared the prevelence of these mutations to the exome-wide mutational excess calculated using non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios (dN/dS). We observed mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between several dysregulated EAC pathways, a result suggestive of strong functional relationships. Indicators of poor prognosis (SMAD4 and GATA4) were verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value. Over 50\% of EACs contained sensitizing events for CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which were highly correlated with clinically relevant sensitivity in a panel of EAC cell lines and organoids. Genomic analysis of 551 esophageal adenocarcinomas identifies new driver mutations and biomarkers associated with poor prognosis. More than 50\% of esophageal adenocarcinomas contain sensitizing events for CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors, thus providing an evidence base for targeted therapeutics.},

              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We

              high sensitivity and specificity is an essential requirement for
              characterizing naturally occurring variation and for
              understanding pathological somatic rearrangements in personal
              genome sequencing data. Of particular interest are integrated
              methods that accurately identify simple and complex
              rearrangements in heterogeneous sequencing datasets at
              single-nucleotide resolution, as an optimal basis for
              investigating the formation mechanisms and functional
              consequences of SVs. RESULTS: We have developed an SV discovery
              method, called DELLY, that integrates short insert paired-ends,
              long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments to accurately
              delineate genomic rearrangements at single-nucleotide resolution.
              DELLY is suitable for detecting copy-number variable deletion and
              tandem duplication events as well as balanced rearrangements such
              as inversions or reciprocal translocations. DELLY, thus, enables
              to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic rearrangements,

              favorably to other SV prediction methods across a wide range of

                 owing to either low coverage data or low intra-sample variant
                 allele frequency. We also report a set of 4,564 validated

              alterations but not both simultaneously, which provides a limited
              view of cancer genome structure. Here, we introduce Weaver, an
              algorithm for the quantification and analysis of allele-specific
              copy numbers of SVs. Weaver uses a Markov random field to
              estimate joint probabilities of allele-specific copy numbers of

              sequencing data. Weaver also predicts the timing of SVs relative

              Weaver using simulations and findings from whole-genome optical
              mapping. We apply Weaver to generate allele-specific copy numbers

              content profiles from NGS data, and consequently predicts regions
              of genomic alteration such as gains, losses and LOH. Taking as
              input aligned reads, Control-FREEC constructs copy number and
              B-allele frequency profiles. The profiles are then normalized,
              segmented and analyzed in order to assign genotype status (copy
              number and allelic content) to each genomic region. When a
              matched normal sample is provided, Control-FREEC discriminates

              receptor 1 (PD-1) are considered front-line therapy in metastatic
              melanoma. The efficacy of PD-1 blockade for patients with
              biologically distinct melanomas arising from acral and mucosal
              surfaces has not been well described. METHODS: A
              multi-institutional, retrospective cohort analysis identified
              adults with advanced acral and mucosal melanoma who received
              treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab as standard clinical
              practice through expanded access programs or published
              prospective trials. Objective responses were determined using
              investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
              Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Progression-free survival and
              overall survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
              RESULTS: Sixty individuals were identified, including 25 (42\%)
              with acral melanoma and 35 (58\%) with mucosal melanoma.
              Fifty-one patients (85\%) had received previous therapy,
              including 77\% who had previously received ipilimumab. Forty
              patients (67\%) received pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10
              mg/kg, and 20 (33\%) received nivolumab at a doses ranging from
              0.3 to 10 mg/kg every 2 to 3 weeks. The objective response rate
              was 32\% (95\% confidence interval, 15\%-54\%) in patients with
              acral melanoma and 23\% (95\% confidence interval, 10\%-40\%) in
              those with mucosal melanoma. After a median follow-up of 20
              months in the acral melanoma group and 10.6 months in the mucosal
              melanoma group, the median progression-free survival was 4.1
              months and 3.9 months, respectively. Only 2 patients (3\%)
              discontinued treatment because of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Response
              rates to PD-1 blockade in patients with acral and mucosal
              melanomas were comparable to the published rates in patients with
              cutaneous melanoma and support the routine use of PD-1 blockade
              in clinical practice. Further investigation is needed to identify

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Findings based on recent advances in next-generation
              sequence analysis suggest that, in some tumors, a single
              catastrophic event, termed chromothripsis, results in several
              simultaneous tumorigenic alterations. Previous studies have
              suggested that glioblastoma (GBM) may exhibit chromothripsis at a
              higher rate (39\%) than other tumors (9\%). Primary glioblastoma
              is an aggressive form of brain cancer that typically appears
              suddenly in older adults. With aggressive treatment, the median
              survival time is only 15 months. Their acute onset and widespread
              genomic instability indicates that chromothripsis may play a key
              role in their initiation and progression. GBMs are often
              characterized by EGFR amplification, CDKN2A and PTEN deletion,
              although approximately 20\% of GBMs harbor additional
              amplifications in MDM2 or MDM4 with CDK4. METHODS: We used the
              chromothripsis prediction tool, Shatterproof, in conjunction with
              a custom whole genome sequence analysis pipeline in order to
              generate putative regions of chromothripsis. The data derived
              from this study was further expanded on using fluorescence in
              situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and susceptibility studies
              with colony formation assays. RESULTS: We show that primary GBMs
              are associated with higher chromothripsis scores and establish a
              link between chromothripsis and gene amplification of receptor
              tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as well as modulators of the TP53 and
              RB1 pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a newly introduced
              bioinformatic tool, we provide evidence that chromothripsis is
              associated with the formation of amplicons containing several
              oncogenes involved in key pathways that are likely essential for
              post-chromothriptic cell survival.},

  abstract = {Massive genomic rearrangements, a result of single catastrophic
              event termed chromothrispsis or chromosomal catastrophe, have
              been identified in a variety of human cancers. In a few cancer
              types, chromothripsis was found to be associated with poor
              prognosis. We performed mate-pair sequencing and analysis of
              structural rearrangements in 132 prostate cancer cases which
              included clinically insignificant Gleason score 6 tumors,
              clinically significant tumors of higher grade (7+) and high grade
              prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Chromothripsis was observed
              at least 30 per cent of the samples across different grades.
              Surprisingly, it was frequently observed in clinically
              insignificant Gleason score 6 tumors, indicating that
              chromothripsis does not define more aggressive phenotype. The
              degree of chromothripsis did not increase significantly in tumors
              of advanced grades and did not appear to contribute to tumor
              progression. Our data showed that distribution of chromothriptic
              rearrangements differed from that of fragile sites but correlated
              with the size of chromosomes. We also provided evidence that
              rearrangements resulting from chromothripsis were present in the
              cells of neighboring Gleason patterns of the same tumor. Our data
              suggest that that chromothripsis plays role in prostate cancer

              to minimize false-positives while increasing the sensitivity of
              fusion detection. In 9,946 tumor RNA-sequencing datasets from The
              Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across 33 tumor types, DEEPEST
              identifies 31,007 fusions, 30\% more than identified by other
              methods, while calling 10-fold fewer false-positive fusions in
              nontransformed human tissues. We leverage the increased precision
              of DEEPEST to discover fundamental cancer biology. Namely, 888
              candidate oncogenes are identified based on overrepresentation in
              DEEPEST calls, and 1,078 previously unreported fusions involving
              long intergenic noncoding RNAs, demonstrating a previously
              unappreciated prevalence and potential for function. DEEPEST also
              reveals a high enrichment for fusions involving oncogenes in
              cancers, including ovarian cancer, which has had minimal
              treatment advances in recent decades, finding that more than 50\%
              of tumors harbor gene fusions predicted to be oncogenic. Specific
              protein domains are enriched in DEEPEST calls, indicating a
              global selection for fusion functionality: kinase domains are
              nearly 2-fold more enriched in DEEPEST calls than expected by
              chance, as are domains involved in (anaerobic) metabolism and DNA
              binding. The statistical algorithms, population-level analytic
              framework, and the biological conclusions of DEEPEST call for
              increased attention to gene fusions as drivers of cancer and for

              shortening. We examined whether telomerase activation is

              tested were negative for telomerase activity. Thirteen out of 13
              DNA tumor virus-transformed cell cultures were also negative in
              the pre-crisis (i.e. non-immortalized) stage. Of 35 immortalized
              cell lines, 20 had telomerase activity as expected, but 15 had no
              detectable telomerase. The 15 telomerase-negative immortalized
              cell lines all had very long and heterogeneous telomeres of up to
              50 kb. Hybrids between telomerase-negative and

              Although the mechanism of telomere protection has been studied
              extensively, the fate of double-strand breaks (DSBs) inside
              telomeres is not known. Here, we report that telomere-internal
              FokI-induced DSBs activate ATM kinase-dependent signaling in
              S-phase but are well tolerated and repaired efficiently.
              Homologous recombination contributes to repair, leading to
              increased telomere length heterogeneity typical of the
              alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Furthermore,
              cells accumulate extra chromosomal telomeric signals (ECTS), a
              second hallmark of ALT. Telomere-internal DSBs are also repaired
              by a PARP1- and Ligase3-dependent reaction, suggesting
              alternative non-homologous end-joining (alt-NHEJ), which relies
              on microhomology at DSBs. However, as resected telomere-internal
              DSBs have perfect homology, their PARP1/Lig3-dependent
              end-joining may be more akin to single strand break repair. We
              conclude that shelterin does not repress ATM kinase signaling or
              DSB repair at telomere-internal sites, thereby allowing DNA

              the telomere, composed of repeats of TTAGGG making up a total of
              5-15 kilobase pairs, depending on age and proliferative activity
              of the tissue. The major function of telomeres is to provide
              stability to chromosomes and protect underlying unique coding
              sequences from degradation. There is a loss of telomeric
              sequences following every cell division estimated to be between
              50 and 65 basepairs/cell division in human fibroblasts and
              embryonic kidney cells in vitro. This loss is due to the fact
              that DNA replication is incomplete for one strand at each
              telomere end. In lower eukaryotes there is a compensation
              mechanism provided by the enzyme telomerase, which is inactive in
              human somatic cells. Telomerase activation has also been detected
              in vitro immortalized human cells. In this study we analyzed
              renal cell carcinoma for the occurrence of telomere shortening
              using the probe (TTAGGG)4. Southern blots of HinfI-digested DNA
              revealed a shortening of mean telomere restriction fragment (TRF)
              length of 0.4 to 2.5 kilobase pairs in 2 or 3 intratumoral
              samples in all 10 tumors analyzed. No obvious intratumoral
              heterogeneity was found in mean TRF length values. However,
              heterogeneity was shown by the occurrence of at least two
              separate peak TRF values in 7 of 10 tumors, indicating the
              presence of different tumor cell clones. A conflicting
              observation was made when we evaluated the intensity of the
              hybridization signals, where three of the tumors showed an
              increase in hybridization signals despite concomitant TRF
              reduction. We found no correlation between tumor size and
              calculated tumor cell divisions undergone. In two tumors, the
              calculated cell division cycles were unrealistically low compared
              to the tumor size. These data suggest that telomerase activation

              of TTAGGG repeats. To further define the type and arrangement of
              sequences at the ends of human chromosomes, we developed a direct
              cloning strategy for telomere-associated DNA. The method involves
              a telomere enrichment procedure based on the relative lack of
              restriction endonuclease cutting sites near the ends of human
              chromosomes. Nineteen (TTAGGG)n-bearing plasmids were isolated,
              two of which contain additional human sequences proximal to the
              telomeric repeats. These telomere-flanking sequences detect BAL
              31-sensitive loci and thus are located close to chromosome ends.
              One of the flanking regions is part of a subtelomeric repeat that
              is present at 10 to 25\% of the chromosome ends in the human
              genome. This sequence is not conserved in rodent DNA and
              therefore should be a helpful tool for physical characterization
              of human chromosomes in human-rodent hybrid cell lines; some of
              the chromosomes that may be analyzed in this manner have been
              identified, i.e., 7, 16, 17, and 21. The minimal size of the
              subtelomeric repeat is 4 kilobases (kb); it shows a high
              frequency of restriction fragment length polymorphisms and
              undergoes extensive de novo methylation in somatic cells. Distal
              to the subtelomeric repeat, the chromosomes terminate in a long
              region (up to 14 kb) that may be entirely composed of TTAGGG
              repeats. This terminal segment is unusually variable. Although
              sperm telomeres are 10 to 14 kb long, telomeres in somatic cells
              are several kilobase pairs shorter and very heterogeneous in
              length. Additional telomere reduction occurs in primary tumors,
              indicating that somatic telomeres are unstable and may

              with an average annual loss rate of 46 base pairs (bp). The mean

              controversial. Attempts to dissect the significance of p16(INK4a)
              in response to telomere shortening have been hampered by the
              concomitant induction of p16(INK4a) by cell culture conditions.
              To circumvent this problem, we studied the role of p16(INK4a) in
              the cellular response to acute telomere damage induced by a
              dominant negative allele of TRF2, TRF2(Delta B Delta M). This

              chromosome fusions. End-to-end fusions of metaphase chromosomes
              are observed in mammalian cells with dysfunctional telomeres due
              to diminished function of telomere-associated proteins and in
              cells experiencing extensive attrition of telomeric DNA. However,
              the molecular nature of these fusions and the mechanism by which
              they occur have not been elucidated. RESULTS: We document that
              telomere fusions resulting from inhibition of the
              telomere-protective factor TRF2 are generated by DNA ligase
              IV-dependent nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ gives rise to
              covalent ligation of the C strand of one telomere to the G strand
              of another. Breakage of the resulting dicentric chromosomes
              results in nonreciprocal translocations, a hallmark of human
              cancer. Telomere NHEJ took place before and after DNA
              replication, and both sister telomeres participated in the
              reaction. Telomere fusions were accompanied by active degradation
              of the 3' telomeric overhangs. CONCLUSIONS: The main threat to
              dysfunctional mammalian telomeres is degradation of the 3'
              overhang and subsequent telomere end-joining by DNA ligase IV.
              The involvement of NHEJ in telomere fusions is paradoxical since
              the NHEJ factors Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs are present at telomeres

               amplification of megabase regions, causing a specific subtype of
               acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A subgroup comprising some 2\% of
               patients with the childhood cancer acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
               (ALL) carries an intrachromosomal amplification of one copy of
               chromosome 21, iAMP21, with distinct prognostic and therapeutic
               implications. Peter Campbell and colleagues combined genomic,
               cytogenetic, transcriptional and bioinformatic analyses to
               reconstruct the evolution of this form of ALL. They find that
               the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between
               chromosomes 15 and 21 greatly increases the risk of developing
               iAMP21 ALL. In these cases, amplification is initiated by
               chromothripsis (multiple chromosome rearrangements) involving
               both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel
               mechanism for cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21,
               breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the initiating
               event, often followed by chromothripsis. The data indicate that
               dicentric chromosomes may be an important precipitant of
               chromothripsis. Changes in gene dosage are a major driver of
               cancer, known to be caused by a finite, but increasingly well
               annotated, repertoire of mutational mechanisms1. This can
               potentially generate correlated copy-number alterations across
               hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2\% of childhood
               acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification
               of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)2,3. We used
               genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with
               novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of
               iAMP21 ALL. Here we show that individuals born with the rare
               constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15
               and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have approximately 2,700-fold
               increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general
               population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a
               chromothripsis event involving both sister chromatids of the
               Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for cancer
               predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge
               cycles are typically the initiating event, often followed by
               chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated
               iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the
               entire abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative of
               chromosome 21 or the rob(15;21)c chromosome with gene dosage
               optimized for leukaemic potential, showing constrained
               copy-number levels over multiple linked genes. Thus, dicentric
               chromosomes may be an important precipitant of chromothripsis,
               as we show rob(15;21)c to be constitutionally dicentric and
               breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generate dicentric chromosomes
               somatically. Furthermore, our data illustrate that several
               cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can
               coordinate to fashion copy-number profiles over large genomic
               scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of

  abstract  = "Uterine leiomyosarcomas (uLMS) are aggressive tumors arising
               from the smooth muscle layer of the uterus. We analyzed 83 uLMS
               sample genetics, including 56 from Yale and 27 from The Cancer
               Genome Atlas (TCGA). Among them, a total of 55 Yale samples
               including two patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and 27 TCGA
               samples have whole-exome sequencing (WES) data; 10 Yale and 27
               TCGA samples have RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data; and 11 Yale and
               10 TCGA samples have whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. We
               found recurrent somatic mutations in TP53, MED12, and PTEN
               genes. Top somatic mutated genes included TP53, ATRX, PTEN, and
               MEN1 genes. Somatic copy number variation (CNV) analysis
               identified 8 copy-number gains, including 5p15.33 (TERT),
               8q24.21 (C-MYC), and 17p11.2 (MYOCD, MAP2K4) amplifications and
               29 copy-number losses. Fusions involving tumor suppressors or
               oncogenes were deetected, with most fusions disrupting RB1,
               TP53, and ATRX/DAXX, and one fusion (ACTG2-ALK) being
               potentially targetable. WGS results demonstrated that 76\% (16
               of 21) of the samples harbored chromoplexy and/or
               chromothripsis. Clinically actionable mutational signatures of
               homologous-recombination DNA-repair deficiency (HRD) and
               microsatellite instability (MSI) were identified in 25\% (12 of
               48) and 2\% (1 of 48) of fresh frozen uLMS, respectively.
               Finally, we found olaparib (PARPi; P = 0.002), GS-626510

              human tumors, chromosomal breakpoint profiles were constructed
              for 102 pancreatic carcinomas and 140 osteosarcomas, two tumor
              types characterized by extensive genomic instability. Cases with
              few chromosomal alterations showed a preferential clustering of
              breakpoints to the terminal bands, whereas tumors with many
              changes showed primarily interstitial and centromeric
              breakpoints. The terminal breakpoint frequency was negatively
              correlated to telomeric TTAGGG repeat length, and fluorescence in
              situ hybridization with telomeric TTAGGG probes consistently
              indicated shortened telomeres and >10\% of chromosome ends
              lacking telomeric signals. Because telomeric dysfunction may lead
              to formation of unstable ring and dicentric chromosomes, mitotic
              figures were also evaluated. Anaphase bridges were found in all
              cases, and fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated
              extensive structural rearrangements of chromosomes, with terminal
              transferase detection showing fragmented DNA in 5-20\% of
              interphase cells. Less than 2\% of cells showed evidence of
              necrosis or apoptosis, and telomerase was expressed in the

              chromosomal fragmentation through persistent bridge-breakage
              events in pancreatic carcinomas and osteosarcomas, leading to a

              cells, telomere erosion represents an innate mechanism for tumor
              suppression and may contribute to age-related disease. A detailed
              understanding of the pathways that link shortened telomeres to
              replicative senescence has been severely hindered by the
              inability of current methods to analyze telomere dynamics in
              detail. Here we describe single telomere length analysis (STELA),
              a PCR-based approach that accurately measures the full spectrum
              of telomere lengths from individual chromosomes. STELA analysis
              of human XpYp telomeres in fibroblasts identifies several
              features of telomere biology. We observe bimodal distributions of
              telomeres in normal fibroblasts; these distributions result from
              inter-allelic differences of up to 6.5 kb, indicating that
              unexpectedly large-scale differences in zygotic telomere length
              are maintained throughout development. Most telomeres shorten in
              a gradual fashion consistent with simple losses through end
              replication, and the rates of erosion are independent of allele
              size. Superimposed on this are occasional, more substantial
              changes in length, which may be the consequence of additional
              mutational mechanisms. Notably, some alleles show almost complete

              used for personal and cancer genomics as well as in various
              research areas. However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome
              truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading
              causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great
              efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. RESULTS: We
              made 10 single nucleotide polymorphism and INDEL call sets with
              two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid
              human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By
              investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we
              identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions
              and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as
              the two major sources of errors, which press for continued
              improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate
              of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15 kb, but the error
              rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200 kb without

              cancer. Telomeres progressively shorten in almost all dividing

              telomerase activity to fully maintain telomeres. There is
              accumulating evidence that when only a few telomeres are short,
              they form end-associations, leading to a DNA damage signal
              resulting in replicative senescence (a cellular growth arrest,
              also called the M1 stage). In the absence of cell-cycle
              checkpoint pathways (e.g. p53 and or p16/Rb), cells bypass M1
              senescence and telomeres continue to shorten eventually resulting
              in crisis (also called the M2 stage). M2 is characterized by many
              'uncapped' chromosome ends, end-fusions, chromosome breakage

              observations by investigating two N-terminal phosphorylation
              sites in Myc, Thr 58 and Ser 62, which are known to be regulated
              by mitogen stimulation. We now show that the phosphorylation of
              these two residues is critical for determining the stability of
              Myc. Phosphorylation of Ser 62 is required for Ras-induced
              stabilization of Myc, likely mediated through the action of ERK.
              Conversely, phosphorylation of Thr 58, likely mediated by GSK-3

              associated with degradation of Myc. Further analysis demonstrates

              carcinogenesis. By using single-molecule approaches to
              characterize fusion events, we provide a functional definition of
              fusogenic telomeres in human cells. We show that approximately
              half of the fusion events contained no canonical telomere repeats
              at the fusion point; of those that did, the longest was 12.8
              repeats. Furthermore, in addition to end-replication losses,
              human telomeres are subjected to large-scale deletion events that
              occur in the presence or absence of telomerase. Here we show that
              these telomeres are fusogenic, and thus despite the majority of
              telomeres being maintained at a stable length in normal human
              cells, a subset of stochastically shortened telomeres can
              potentially cause chromosomal instability. Telomere fusion was
              accompanied by the deletion of one or both telomeres extending
              several kilobases into the telomere-adjacent DNA, and
              microhomology was observed at the fusion points. This contrasted
              with telomere fusion that was observed following the experimental
              disruption of TRF2. The distinct error-prone mutational profile
              of fusion between critically shortened telomeres in human cells

               (see the Perspective by Paiano and Nussenzweig). They found that
               chromothripsis arises from a cascade of events that begins with
               aberrant chromosome bridge formation during mitosis, followed by
               chromosome fragmentation, DNA damage, chromosome missegregation,
               and the formation of micronuclei. They propose a model that
               explains how a single cell division error (chromosome bridge

               [eaba0712][2] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION The chromosome
               breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle is a catastrophic mutational
               process, common during tumorigenesis, that results in gene
               amplification and drives rapid genome evolution. Major
               mechanisms underlying the BFB cycle are not understood,
               including its key feature of how chromosome bridges are broken.
               Furthermore, the simple pattern of DNA sequence rearrangement
               predicted by the canonical BFB model is not commonly observed in
               cancer genomes. Instead, the DNA sequence signature of BFB
               cycles is often accompanied by other genomic rearrangements,
               including chromothripsis, another catastrophic mutational
               pattern. \#\#\# RATIONALE We recreated essential steps of the
               BFB cycle in a defined system, enabling mechanistic studies and
               determination of the immediate and long-term genomic
               consequences of bridge formation. To identify the immediate
               outcomes of bridge breakage, we used live-cell imaging coupled
               with single-cell whole-genome sequencing (Look-Seq). Complex
               mutational mechanisms, some of which occurred over two
               generations, could be deconvolved by the comparison of haplotype
               copy number and structural variants in daughter or granddaughter
               cells. We then determined the long-term consequences of bridge
               breakage with genomic analysis of populations derived from
               single cells after breakage of a bridge formed from an
               experimentally induced dicentric fusion of chromosome 4. \#\#\#
               RESULTS We showed that chromosome bridge breakage requires
               actomyosin-dependent mechanical force. Bridge formation and
               breakage is then coupled to a cascade of additional mutational
               events. For the initial step, we determined that direct
               mechanical bridge breakage can generate simple breaks and local
               DNA fragmentation, providing one explanation for a rearrangement
               pattern frequently observed in cancer genomes termed ``local
               jumps.'' Concomitantly, there is defective DNA replication of
               bridge DNA, which our data suggest can generate complex
               rearrangements. Some of these rearrangements exhibit a distinct
               sequence signature of tandem arrays of many short (~200 base
               pairs) insertions that we term ``Tandem Short Template (TST)
               jumps.'' We validated the presence of TST jumps in a human
               cancer by use of single-molecule long-read DNA sequencing. Next,
               a second wave of DNA damage and increased chromothripsis occurs
               during the mitosis after bridge formation, when chromosomes from
               broken bridges undergo an unexpected burst of aberrant DNA
               replication. Last, these damaged bridge chromosomes missegregate
               with high frequency and form micronuclei in the following cell
               cycle, which can generate additional cycles of bridging,
               micronucleation, and chromothripsis. Genome sequence analysis of
               clonal populations established that the breakage of chromosome
               bridges initiates iterative cycles of complex karyotype
               evolution. We observed an analogous series of events after the
               formation of micronuclei, suggesting a unifying model for how
               cancer-associated defects in nuclear architecture (``nuclear
               atypia'') promote genome instability. \#\#\# CONCLUSION We
               identified a cascade of events that explains how a single cell
               division error---chromosome bridge formation---can rapidly
               generate many hallmark features of cancer genomes, including
               ongoing genome evolution with subclonal heterogeneity. These
               results motivate a substantial revision of the chromosome BFB
               model, establishing that episodes of chromothripsis will be
               inherently interwoven with BFB cycles. These mutational events
               are common in cancer but likely also occur during development
               and across organismal evolution. ![Figure][3] A storm of
               mutagenesis generates cancer genome complexity from a single
               cell division error. The interphase actomyosin cytoskeleton
               (green fibers) stretches and breaks chromosome bridges,
               promoting local chromosome fragmentation (damaged DNA indicated
               in red). Defective DNA replication, first during interphase and
               later in the subsequent mitosis, generates additional DNA damage
               and chromothripsis, in some instances leaving behind a specific
               mutational signature (TST jumps). Bridge chromosomes frequently
               missegregate and form micronuclei, promoting additional
               chromothripsis. The chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB)
               cycle is a mutational process that produces gene amplification
               and genome instability. Signatures of BFB cycles can be observed
               in cancer genomes alongside chromothripsis, another catastrophic
               mutational phenomenon. We explain this association by
               elucidating a mutational cascade that is triggered by a single
               cell division error---chromosome bridge formation---that rapidly
               increases genomic complexity. We show that actomyosin forces are
               required for initial bridge breakage. Chromothripsis
               accumulates, beginning with aberrant interphase replication of
               bridge DNA. A subsequent burst of DNA replication in the next
               mitosis generates extensive DNA damage. During this second cell
               division, broken bridge chromosomes frequently missegregate and
               form micronuclei, promoting additional chromothripsis. We
               propose that iterations of this mutational cascade generate the
               continuing evolution and subclonal heterogeneity characteristic
               of many human cancers. [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb4899

              cell isolates that developed chemotherapeutic resistance to show
              that chromothripsis is a major driver of circular
              extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplification (also known as double
              minutes) through mechanisms that depend on poly(ADP-ribose)
              polymerases (PARP) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent
              protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Longitudinal analyses revealed that a
              further increase in drug tolerance is achieved by structural
              evolution of ecDNAs through additional rounds of chromothripsis.
              In situ Hi-C sequencing showed that ecDNAs preferentially tether
              near chromosome ends, where they re-integrate when DNA damage is
              present. Intrachromosomal amplifications that formed initially
              under low-level drug selection underwent continuing
              breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, generating amplicons more than 100
              megabases in length that became trapped within interphase bridges
              and then shattered, thereby producing micronuclei whose
              encapsulated ecDNAs are substrates for chromothripsis. We

              in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an
              elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation
              burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which
              contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of
              these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues
              directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to
              misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens.
              Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by
              APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike
              mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited
              differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the

              driver alterations in the remaining cases are yet to be
              determined. Recent exome sequencing analysis has identified SOS1,

              common in human cancer, likely occur in cells that are already
              aneuploid, and influence pathways of tumor progression (for
              example, with recessive inactivation of NF1 being less common

              Here we present the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of

              unsupervised clustering based on genomic features, we define

                 carcinomas of the breast and colon, whereas mice carrying
                 common tumour suppressor gene mutations typically develop soft
                 tissue sarcomas and lymphomas. Among the many factors that may
                 contribute to this species variance are differences in
                 telomere length and regulation. Telomeres comprise the
                 nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of eukaryotic
                 chromosomes and are maintained by the reverse transcriptase,
                 telomerase. In human cells, insufficient levels of telomerase
                 lead to telomere attrition with cell division in culture and
                 possibly with ageing and tumorigenesis in vivo. In contrast,
                 critical reduction in telomere length is not observed in the
                 mouse owing to promiscuous telomerase expression and long
                 telomeres. Here we provide evidence that telomere attrition in
                 ageing telomerase-deficient p53 mutant mice promotes the
                 development of epithelial cancers by a process of
                 fusion-bridge breakage that leads to the formation of complex
                 non-reciprocal translocations--a classical cytogenetic feature
                 of human carcinomas. Our data suggest a model in which
                 telomere dysfunction brought about by continual epithelial
                 renewal during life generates the massive ploidy changes

              comutations define distinct subgroups of KRAS-mutant LUAC. Here,
              we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups.
              Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly
              among KL (7.4\%), KP (35.7\%), and K-only (28.6\%) subgroups (P <

              with KRAS-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in
              the CheckMate-057 phase III trial (0\% vs. 57.1\% vs. 18.2\%; P =
              0.047). In the SU2C cohort, KL LUAC exhibited shorter
              progression-free (P < 0.001) and overall (P = 0.0015) survival
              compared with KRASMUT;STK11/LKB1WT LUAC. Among 924 LUACs,
              STK11/LKB1 alterations were the only marker significantly
              associated with PD-L1 negativity in TMBIntermediate/High LUAC.
              The impact of STK11/LKB1 alterations on clinical outcomes with
              PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell

              States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate
              (2006-2015) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2\%

              tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.
              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor
              impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that
              the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure

              associated with poor response to standard therapies. Efforts to
              target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to
              its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known
              allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in
              functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP
              hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the
              nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative
              nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an
              advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active
              GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules
              that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C).
              These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and
              therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic
              studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent
              in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding
              switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C)
              disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native
              nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing
              binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a

              sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited
              in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific
              questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the
              data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome
              Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework
              designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis
              tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional
              programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small
              but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority
              of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations
              from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize
              the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory
              efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory
              parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by
              describing the implementation and application of robust,
              scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK
              programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly
              and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which
              have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Exome or whole-genome deep sequencing of tumor DNA
              along with paired normal DNA can potentially provide a detailed
              picture of the somatic mutations that characterize the tumor.
              However, analysis of such sequence data can be complicated by the
              presence of normal cells in the tumor specimen, by intratumor
              heterogeneity, and by the sheer size of the raw data. In
              particular, determination of copy number variations from exome
              sequencing data alone has proven difficult; thus, single
              nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have often been used for
              this task. Recently, algorithms to estimate absolute, but not
              allele-specific, copy number profiles from tumor sequencing data
              have been described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed
              Sequenza, a software package that uses paired tumor-normal DNA
              sequencing data to estimate tumor cellularity and ploidy, and to
              calculate allele-specific copy number profiles and mutation
              profiles. We applied Sequenza, as well as two previously
              published algorithms, to exome sequence data from 30 tumors from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas. We assessed the performance of these
              algorithms by comparing their results with those generated using
              matched SNP arrays and processed by the allele-specific copy
              number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm. RESULTS: Comparison
              between Sequenza/exome and SNP/ASCAT revealed strong correlation
              in cellularity (Pearson's r = 0.90) and ploidy estimates (r =
              0.42, or r = 0.94 after manual inspecting alternative solutions).
              This performance was noticeably superior to previously published
              algorithms. In addition, in artificial data simulating
              normal-tumor admixtures, Sequenza detected the correct ploidy in
              samples with tumor content as low as 30\%. CONCLUSIONS: The
              agreement between Sequenza and SNP array-based copy number
              profiles suggests that exome sequencing alone is sufficient not
              only for identifying small scale mutations but also for
              estimating cellularity and inferring DNA copy number aberrations.",

              The ultimate receptor of these mitogenic signals is the
              retinoblastoma (Rb) family of pocket proteins, whose inactivation
              is a required step to license cell proliferation. However, little
              is known regarding the molecular events that connect Ras
              signaling with the cell cycle. Here, we provide genetic evidence
              to illustrate that the p53/p21 Cdk-interacting protein 1
              (Cip1)/Rb axis is an essential component of the Ras signaling
              pathway. Indeed, knockdown of p53, p21Cip1, or Rb restores
              proliferative properties in cells arrested by ablation of the
              three Ras loci, H-, N- and K-Ras. Ras signaling selectively
              inactivates p53-mediated induction of p21Cip1 expression by
              inhibiting acetylation of specific lysine residues in the p53 DNA

              unveil a previously unidentified role for p53 in preventing cell
              proliferation under unfavorable mitogenic conditions. Moreover,
              we provide evidence that cells lacking Ras and p53 proteins owe

              Classical studies suggested that AT1 arise from AT2 cells, but
              recent studies propose other sources. Here we use molecular
              markers, lineage tracing and clonal analysis to map alveolar

              self-renewing, long-lived, mature AT2 cells that produce slowly
              expanding clonal foci of alveolar renewal. This stem-cell
              function is broadly activated by AT1 injury, and AT2 self-renewal
              is selectively induced by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
              ligands in vitro and oncogenic Kras(G12D) in vivo, efficiently

              that local signals regulate AT2 stem-cell activity: a signal
              transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls self-renewal and is hijacked

              restriction to ellipsoidal contours. To address and overcome such

              For the goal of threshold type outlier detection, it is found

              view of its contours not constrained to be elliptical and its
              computational burden relatively mild. A small sampling experiment
              yields findings completely in accordance with the theoretical
              comparisons. While these four depth procedures are relatively
              comparable for the purpose of robust affine equivariant location
              estimation, the halfspace depth is not competitive with the

              tool MGRA2 can handle gene gain/loss events and shares the
              ability of MGRA to reconstruct ancestral genomes uniquely in the
              case of limited breakpoint reuse. Furthermore, MGRA2 employs a
              number of novel heuristics to cope with higher breakpoint reuse
              and process datasets inaccessible for MGRA. In practical

               additional means to support or refute putative events. Here, we

               calls with sequence depth information that can add (or remove)
               confidence to SVs that are predicted to affect copy number.
               Duphold indicates not only the change in depth across the event
               but also the presence of a rapid change in depth relative to the
               regions surrounding the break-points. It uses a unique algorithm
               that allows the run time to be nearly independent of the number

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Sequence assembly is a difficult problem whose
              importance has grown again recently as the cost of sequencing has
              dramatically dropped. Most new sequence assembly software has
              started by building a de Bruijn graph, avoiding the overlap-based
              methods used previously because of the computational cost and
              complexity of these with very large numbers of short reads. Here,
              we show how to use suffix array-based methods that have formed
              the basis of recent very fast sequence mapping algorithms to find
              overlaps and generate assembly string graphs asymptotically
              faster than previously described algorithms. RESULTS: Standard
              overlap assembly methods have time complexity O(N(2)), where N is
              the sum of the lengths of the reads. We use the Ferragina-Manzini
              index (FM-index) derived from the Burrows-Wheeler transform to
              find overlaps of length at least tau among a set of reads. As
              well as an approach that finds all overlaps then implements
              transitive reduction to produce a string graph, we show how to
              output directly only the irreducible overlaps, significantly
              shrinking memory requirements and reducing compute time to O(N),
              independent of depth. Overlap-based assembly methods naturally
              handle mixed length read sets, including capillary reads or long
              reads promised by the third generation sequencing technologies.
              The algorithms we present here pave the way for overlap-based

              Cancer mutations are not distributed uniformly along the human

              fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations, posing
              a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer
              genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major
              determinant of the cancer mutational landscape. However, both
              somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly
              cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of mutations
              in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and
              compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we
              show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with
              replication timing, explain up to 86\% of the variance in
              mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local
              somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the
              most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy.
              Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much
              stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin
              features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that
              the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined

              the DNA sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of

              that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster
              often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids
              that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that
              the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that
              changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the
              Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive
              and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome

  abstract = "Purpose:KRAS mutations occur in approximately 25\% of patients
              with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the uniform
              presence of KRAS mutations, patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC can
              have a heterogeneous clinical course. As the pattern of
              co-occurring mutations may describe different biological subsets
              of patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, we explored the
              effects of co-occurring mutations on patient outcomes and
              response to therapy.Experimental Design: We identified patients
              with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC and evaluated the most common
              co-occurring genomic alterations. Multivariate analyses were
              performed incorporating the most frequent co-mutations and
              clinical characteristics to evaluate association with overall
              survival as well as response to platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy
              and immune checkpoint inhibitors.Results: Among 330 patients with
              advanced KRAS-mutant lung cancers, the most frequent co-mutations
              were found in TP53 (42\%), STK11 (29\%), and KEAP1/NFE2L2 (27\%).
              In a multivariate analysis, there was a significantly shorter
              survival in patients with co-mutations in KEAP1/NFE2L2 [HR, 1.96;
              95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.33-2.92; P $\leq$ 0.001]. STK11
              (HR, 1.3; P = 0.22) and TP53 (HR 1.11, P = 0.58) co-mutation
              statuses were not associated with survival. Co-mutation in
              KEAP1/NFE2L2 was also associated with shorter duration of initial
              chemotherapy (HR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.59; P = 0.03) and shorter
              overall survival from initiation of immune therapy (HR, 3.54;
              95\% CI, 1.55-8.11; P = 0.003).Conclusions: Among people with
              KRAS-mutant advanced NSCLC, TP53, STK11, and KEAP1/NFE2L2 are the
              most commonly co-occurring somatic genomic alterations.
              Co-mutation of KRAS and KEAP1/ NFE2L2 is an independent
              prognostic factor, predicting shorter survival, duration of
              response to initial platinum-based chemotherapy, and survival

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions have been studied extensively, as
              frequent drivers of tumorigenesis as well as potential
              therapeutic targets. In many well-known cases, breakpoints occur
              at two intragenic positions, leading to in-frame gene-gene
              fusions that generate chimeric mRNAs. However, fusions often
              occur with intergenic breakpoints, and the role of such fusions
              has not been carefully examined. RESULTS: We analyze whole-genome
              sequencing data from 268 patients to catalog gene-intergenic and
              intergenic-intergenic fusions and characterize their impact.
              First, we discover that, in contrast to the common assumption,
              chimeric oncogenic transcripts-such as those involving ETV4, ERG,
              RSPO3, and PIK3CA-can be generated by gene-intergenic fusions
              through splicing of the intervening region. Second, we find that
              over-expression of an upstream or downstream gene by a
              fusion-mediated repositioning of a regulatory sequence is much
              more common than previously suspected, with enhancers sometimes

  abstract = "Cancer genome sequencing has revealed considerable variation in
              somatic mutation rates across the human genome, with mutation
              rates elevated in heterochromatic late replicating regions and
              reduced in early replicating euchromatin. Multiple mechanisms
              have been suggested to underlie this, but the actual cause is
              unknown. Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as
              the basis of this variation. Analysing ∼17 million
              single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we
              show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase
              resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with
              differences related to changes in replication timing and gene
              expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of
              MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin
              relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA
              repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome graph is an emerging approach for representing
              structural variants on genomes with branches. For example,
              representing structural variants of cancer genomes as a genome
              graph is more natural than representing such genomes as
              differences from the linear reference genome. While more and more
              structural variants are being identified by long-read sequencing,
              many of them are difficult to visualize using existing structural
              variants visualization tools. To this end, visualization method
              for large genome graphs such as human cancer genome graphs is
              demanded. RESULTS: We developed MOdular Multi-scale Integrated
              Genome graph browser, MoMI-G, a web-based genome graph browser
              that can visualize genome graphs with structural variants and
              supporting evidences such as read alignments, read depth, and
              annotations. This browser allows more intuitive recognition of
              large, nested, and potentially more complex structural
              variations. MoMI-G has view modules for different scales, which
              allow users to view the whole genome down to nucleotide-level
              alignments of long reads. Alignments spanning reference alleles
              and those spanning alternative alleles are shown in the same
              view. Users can customize the view, if they are not satisfied
              with the preset views. In addition, MoMI-G has Interval Card
              Deck, a feature for rapid manual inspection of hundreds of
              structural variants. Herein, we describe the utility of MoMI-G by
              using representative examples of large and nested structural
              variations found in two cell lines, LC-2/ad and CHM1.
              CONCLUSIONS: Users can inspect complex and large structural
              variations found by long-read analysis in large genomes such as
              human genomes more smoothly and more intuitively. In addition,
              users can easily filter out false positives by manually
              inspecting hundreds of identified structural variants with
              supporting long-read alignments and annotations in a short time.

              environmental conditions is frequently associated with changes in
              extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) sequences. Although
              variable in size, sequence complexity, and copy number, the best
              characterized of these eccDNAs contain sequences homologous to
              chromosomal DNA which indicates that they might arise from
              genetic rearrangements, such as homologous recombination. The
              abundance of repetitive sequence families in eccDNAs is
              consistent with the notion that tandem repeats and dispersed
              repetitive elements participate in intrachromosomal recombination
              events. There is also evidence that a fraction of this DNA has
              characteristics similar to retrotransposons. It has been
              suggested that eccDNAs could reflect altered patterns of gene

              genomics. Many pangenomic analyses use bidirected sequence graphs
              as their core data model. However, implementing and correctly
              using this data model can be difficult, and the scale of
              pangenomic datasets can be challenging to work at. These
              challenges have impeded progress in this field. RESULTS: Here, we
              present a stack of two C++ libraries, libbdsg and libhandlegraph,
              which use a simple, field-proven interface, designed to expose
              elementary features of these graphs while preventing common graph
              manipulation mistakes. The libraries also provide a Python
              binding. Using a diverse collection of pangenome graphs, we
              demonstrate that these tools allow for efficient construction and
              manipulation of large genome graphs with dense variation. For
              instance, the speed and memory usage are up to an order of
              magnitude better than the prior graph implementation in the VG

               complex and Mendelian disease programs, and medical genetic
               initiatives are reliant upon short-read whole-genome sequencing
               (srWGS), which presents challenges for the detection of
               structural variants (SVs) relative to emerging long-read WGS
               (lrWGS) technologies. Given this ubiquity of srWGS in
               large-scale genomics initiatives, we sought to establish
               expectations for routine SV detection from this data type by
               comparison with lrWGS assembly, as well as to quantify the
               genomic properties and added value of SVs uniquely accessible to
               each technology. Analyses from the Human Genome Structural
               Variation Consortium (HGSVC) of three families captured ~11,000
               SVs per genome from srWGS and ~25,000 SVs per genome from lrWGS
               assembly. Detection power and precision for SV discovery varied
               dramatically by genomic context and variant class: 9.7\% of the
               current GRCh38 reference is defined by segmental duplication
               (SD) and simple repeat (SR), yet 91.4\% of deletions that were
               specifically discovered by lrWGS localized to these regions.
               Across the remaining 90.3\% of reference sequence, we observed
               extremely high (93.8\%) concordance between technologies for
               deletions in these datasets. In contrast, lrWGS was superior for
               detection of insertions across all genomic contexts. Given that
               non-SD/SR sequences encompass 95.9\% of currently annotated
               disease-associated exons, improved sensitivity from lrWGS to
               discover novel pathogenic deletions in these currently
               interpretable genomic regions is likely to be incremental.
               However, these analyses highlight the considerable added value
               of assembly-based lrWGS to create new catalogs of insertions and
               transposable elements, as well as disease-associated repeat
               expansions in genomic sequences that were previously

              copy number polymorphism important for disease risk, and an 863
              kbp variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can
              function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric
              $\alpha$-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73
              kbp hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order
              $\alpha$-satellite enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent
              with the location of the kinetochore. Using a dual long-read
              sequencing approach, we complete the assembly of the orthologous
              chromosome 8 centromeric regions in chimpanzee, orangutan, and
              macaque for the first time to reconstruct its evolutionary
              history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the
              higher-order $\alpha$-satellite structure evolved specifically in
              the great ape ancestor, and the centromeric region evolved with a
              layered symmetry, with more ancient higher-order repeats located
              at the periphery adjacent to monomeric $\alpha$-satellites. We
              estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is
              accelerated at least 2.2-fold, and this acceleration extends
              beyond the higher-order $\alpha$-satellite into the flanking
              sequence. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have

              Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the
              continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere
              assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by
              high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the
              complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with
              complementary technologies for quality improvement and
              validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we
              reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately
              3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current

  abstract = "Added by telomerase, arrays of TTAGGG repeats specify the ends of

              proteins associates with this sequence and protects chromosome
              ends. By analogy to other chromosomal protein complexes such as
              condensin and cohesin, I will refer to this complex as shelterin.
              Three shelterin subunits, TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 directly recognize
              TTAGGG repeats. They are interconnected by three additional
              shelterin proteins, TIN2, TPP1, and Rap1, forming a complex that
              allows cells to distinguish telomeres from sites of DNA damage.
              Without the protective activity of shelterin, telomeres are no
              longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome
              ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. How
              does shelterin avert these events? The current data argue that
              shelterin is not a static structural component of the telomere.
              Instead, shelterin is emerging as a protein complex with DNA
              remodeling activity that acts together with several associated
              DNA repair factors to change the structure of the telomeric DNA,
              thereby protecting chromosome ends. Six shelterin subunits: TRF1,

              pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect
              infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of
              disease course. To address these challenges, we designed a fast
              (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection
              from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun
              metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and
              microbial profiling. We applied these methods to clinical
              specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the
              first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular
              portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease. We find significant
              enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well
              as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and
              olfaction pathways. In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to
              find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a
              protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar
              drugs. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient
              autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with
              macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. These
              findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive
              SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies.",

  abstract = "The foundational principles of Darwinian evolution are variation,
              selection, and identity by descent. Oncogene amplification on
              extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a common event, driving
              aggressive tumour growth, drug resistance, and shorter survival
              in patients. Currently, the impact of non-chromosomal oncogene
              inheritance - random identity by descent - is not well
              understood. Neither is the impact of ecDNA on variation and
              selection. Here, integrating mathematical modeling, unbiased
              image analysis, CRISPR-based ecDNA tagging, and live-cell
              imaging, we identify a set of basic rules for how random ecDNA
              inheritance drives oncogene copy number and distribution,
              resulting in extensive intratumoural ecDNA copy number
              heterogeneity and rapid adaptation to metabolic stress and
              targeted cancer treatment. Observed ecDNAs obligatorily benefit
              host cell survival or growth and can change within a single cell
              cycle. In studies ranging from well-curated, patient-derived
              cancer cell cultures to clinical tumour samples from patients
              with glioblastoma and neuroblastoma treated with
              oncogene-targeted drugs, we show how these ecDNA inheritance
              rules can predict, a priori, some of the aggressive features of
              ecDNA-containing cancers. These properties are entailed by their
              ability to rapidly change their genomes in a way that is not
              possible for cancers driven by chromosomal oncogene
              amplification. These results shed new light on how the
              non-chromosomal random inheritance pattern of ecDNA underlies
              poor outcomes for cancer patients. \#\#\# Competing Interest

              with poor treatment efficacy. A better understanding of the
              characteristics of late-stage cancer is required to help adapt
              personalized treatments, reduce overtreatment and improve
              outcomes. Here we describe the largest, to our knowledge,
              pan-cancer study of metastatic solid tumour genomes, including
              whole-genome sequencing data for 2,520 pairs of tumour and normal
              tissue, analysed at median depths of 106$\times$ and 38$\times$,
              respectively, and surveying more than 70 million somatic
              variants. The characteristic mutations of metastatic lesions
              varied widely, with mutations that reflect those of the primary
              tumour types, and with high rates of whole-genome duplication
              events (56\%). Individual metastatic lesions were relatively
              homogeneous, with the vast majority (96\%) of driver mutations
              being clonal and up to 80\% of tumour-suppressor genes being
              inactivated bi-allelically by different mutational mechanisms.
              Although metastatic tumour genomes showed similar mutational
              landscape and driver genes to primary tumours, we find
              characteristics that could contribute to responsiveness to
              therapy or resistance in individual patients. We implement an
              approach for the review of clinically relevant associations and
              their potential for actionability. For 62\% of patients, we
              identify genetic variants that may be used to stratify patients
              towards therapies that either have been approved or are in
              clinical trials. This demonstrates the importance of
